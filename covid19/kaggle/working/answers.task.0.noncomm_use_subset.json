    "Despite the versatile tunability of the emission peaks of QDs in multiplexed diagnostic systems, few reports show their application in clinical diagnostics [29, 30] . Since high-fluorescent QDs are usually synthesized at elevated temperatures in organic solvents, they are only soluble in non-polar organic solvents, which are not suitable for biological applications, water compatibility, and bioconjugation. When QDs are covered with hydrophilic shells using tedious processing [31] , the signal is too weak for the visible readouts of POCT requiring encapsulation of many QDs in an individual nanoparticle [32] ."

Interestingly, the typical symptoms of chronic diarrhea continued in the heifer in Case 3 from the lactation period to slaughter, indicating that food allergies are a possible cause of EOE from birth to maturity in cattle.",
    "In conclusion, to our knowledge, these cases are the first JB cattle cases of idiopathic EOE. The excretion of spherical tissues in the feces may serve as an important and identifiable clinical sign in affected cattle. Idiopathic EOE should be considered a differential diagnosis in cases of chronic obstinate diarrhea in Jb cattle.",

Parameters reflecting hydration status were all within the normal range. Additionally, although the levels of certain serum biochemical parameters were outside the reference range (e.g., in Case 3, the high GGT concentration [37.0 U/l] was considered to reflect cholangitis diagnosed when the animal was slaughtered), no abnormalities in the biochemical profile of the parameters reflecting albumin and electrolyte levels affected by enteritis were observed. Overall, the results of hematological and biochemical analyses prior to slaughter indicated no signs of inflammatory reaction in 2 of the animals with EOE."

    "In the case of vector-borne diseases, in addition to pathogen and host, infectious cycle requires a third player: the vector. This fact results in a more complex eco-epidemiology. Habitats of arthropod vectors depend on a number of environmental conditions, including range of temperature, humidity, water availability, etc. Arboviruses (i.e., viruses transmitted by arthropod vectors), are distributed necessarily in areas where populations of competent vectors (i.e., vectors which are able to spread the disease to new hosts) are abundant enough. Each arthropod vector species occupies a particular ecological niche within specific environmental conditions, so that its distribution can be greatly affected by changes in temperature, rainfall, humidity, plant coverage, etc. (Randolph and Rogers, 2010; Weaver and Reisen, 2010) .",

Pathology is characterized by generalized edema, hemorrhage, especially in lymph nodes, lungs, heart, and skeletal muscle and necrosis on the surface of the oro-nasal mucosa and gastro-intestinal tract (reviewed in MacLachlan et al., 2009) ."

As a result, Taiwan CDC coordinated with the animal health authorities and local governments to ban vendors from slaughtering and selling live poultry at traditional markets, which has successfully protected people from avian influenza infections since 2013. This was a successful case of communication and engagement across multiple sectors.",

Combined databases, such as the National Health Insurance data and Taiwan CDC's data warehouse for infectious disease surveillance and warning, are routinely used for decision making, risk communication, and epidemic control purposes. Since 2012, a national policy of government open data has further guided health authorities' communication strategies to enhance the transparency and integration of information from diverse resources. 9 In so doing, citizens are provided with increased resources to make well-informed health decisions for themselves and for the wider community through civic participation.

The vesicles can have a unilamellar structure with one layer of phospholipids or a multi-lamellar structure with several concentric phospholipid shells. This platform is highly versatile for cargoes delivery and allows for incorporation of hydrophilic molecules in the inner core and hydrophobic molecules within the phospholipid bilayers. Antigens and adjuvants may thus be incorporated into liposomes based on their lipophilicity [19, 20] .",

In the last section of the review, we review commonly used methods for coupling antigens with nanoparticles. These strategies may spur novel approaches for preparing nanoparticle vaccines."

    "I n late 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) crossed the species barrier from animals to humans. SARS first struck in Guangdong Province, China, and was officially recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2003. After its introduction into human populations in Hong Kong in February 2003, the virus spread across the globe within weeks. A number of superspreading events occurred in several health care settings during the epidemic. When SARS was declared to have been contained (5 July 2003) , there were 8,098 confirmed SARS cases, and 774 of these patients died from the disease. After this catastrophic event, one of the most frequently asked questions was whether SARS would come back.",
    "Kindler et al. report that HCoV-EMC has faster replication kinetics than SARS-CoV in HAE cells (5) . SARS-CoV has a mean incubation period of about 5 days in humans. This relatively \"long\" incubation period allowed the identification and isolation of SARS patients before they became highly infectious during the SARS epidemic. If HCoV-EMC has a very efficient replication rate in the upper human respiratory tract, the potential use of quarantine and isolation policy to contain a possible epidemic would be extremely limited.",
    "It is not known whether HCoV-EMC is going to be fully established in humans. Extensive efforts have been made and will continue to be needed to fight against this possible epidemic. If we are \"lucky\" enough to control this novel disease, more resources should be allocated to different areas of coronavirus studies. Currently, we know some animal coronaviruses in wildlife only at the nucleotide level. In fact, the number of bat species tested for coronaviruses is only a fraction of the total number (\u03fe1,200) of bat species. In addition, there is a lack of biological/biochemical characterization of these animal viruses. Ideally, we should develop an effective universal strategy to treat and prevent human infections caused by animal coronaviruses. The phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses (Fig. 1) suggest that there have been a number of introductions of animal coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and 229E) into humans in the past. The great diversity of coronavirus in bats will surely increase the odds of yet another zoonotic event occurring in the future.",
    "Since the first discovery of HCoV-EMC as the etiological agent of this novel severe respiratory disease (1, 2), researchers have used various strategies to understand virus entry and its replication capability in mammalian cell lines (3, 4) . In the absence of autopsy reports of patients who died from HCoV-EMC, our understanding of virus tropism and pathogenesis in humans is inadequate. Kindler et al. (5) describe the efficient infection and replication of HCoV-EMC in differentiated human primary airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures in vitro. This model was used to culture other human coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 (6). This well-characterized primary culture system exhibits high physiological relevance, reflecting the anatomy of the human conducting airway (7) , and allows better understanding of the cellular tropism of this newly emerged virus."

    "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious pathogen of chickens that replicates primarily in the upper respiratory tract. Secondary replication also occurs in the lower respiratory tract and non-respiratory epithelial cells of the alimentary tract, kidney, and gonads, suggesting various pathologies depend on the type of infected tissue [1] . IBV infection affects egg production of laying hens and growth of broiler chickens, leading to economic losses in the poultry industry that cannot be ignored [3] . IBV is spread by aerosol and is endemic in many countries where chickens are farmed.",
    "Genotyping of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was performed on trachea and kidney samples of six chickens obtained from a single farm in Japan. Using two primer sets targeting the spike (S) protein gene, the S1 and S2 regions of DNA fragments were amplified. Sequences of amplified S1 fragments extracted from both organs were identical among the six chickens, showing a JP-I genotype. Sequences of amplified S2 fragments differed between trachea and kidney samples. The kidney profile showed a group IV genotype, whereas the trachea profile showed an unclassified group. This result showed that two different IBVs infected the six chickens. The first IBV infection induced poor protective immunity in this farm, permitting a second IBV infection to occur.",
    "It is unclear why S2 sequences differed between the kidney and trachea samples of the six chickens, although the S1 sequences were similar (Fig. 1) . One hypothesis is that the primer set for S2 can amplify a wider variety of IBVs than S1. Namely, the S1 primer pair amplified IBV (Far East, JP-I genotype) that is a unique population in kidneys and a minor population in the trachea, but may not amplify the major population of IBV co-infecting the trachea. However, the S1 primer pair, which we used, is synthesized on the conserved region of the S1 gene and is frequently used for IBV genotyping worldwide [1, 9] . Therefore, primer Fig. 3 . Phylogenetic tree based on the partial S gene sequences. Phylogenetic tree analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of amplified S1 (A) and S2 (B) regions were performed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method. Naming of groups followed previous publications [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Sequences of representative IBV were either downloaded through NCBI, PubMed, Nucleotide-searching site, or obtained by our own sequencing."

    "The promoters of most IFIT genes contain one to four IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), typically located within 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site, that are recognized by IFN regulatory factors, leading to rapid induction of transcription. A few IFIT genes, including human IFIT1B, lack ISRE-containing promoters and are not transcriptionally induced by IFN or dsRNA (11, 12) . Sequence similarity between the different IFIT proteins within a species is high (44-98% identity) (11), but they are differentially expressed depending on the cell and tissue type, respond differently to IFN and different viruses, and have different effects on replication of individual viruses, suggesting that different IFITs have non-redundant functions in the host response to viral infection (e.g. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

    "Disease or pathogen-specific public health diagnostic laboratories established to support world health organization (WHO)-specific disease surveillance programs and vaccine-preventable diseases, e.g., national influenza, poliovirus and measles laboratories, led to the 'compartmentalization' of laboratory diagnostic services, segregation of functions, and duplication of facilities and equipment. The situation is further complicated by the siting of various pathogen-specific diagnostic laboratories in different buildings or institutes or different locations within a country, thus preventing more cost-effective measures of sharing common equipment and reagents, clinical samples, information and human resources. Finally, the problem is compounded by policy makers and laboratory managers lacking flexibility and not allowing these disease or pathogen-specific laboratories to adopt a more generic approach in the investigation of infectious disease outbreaks.",
    "Regardless of the category, with some exception for category 4b, effective early detection, identification, characterization, containment, control and ultimately prevention of the emerging infectious diseases will require a good, functional national public health surveillance system. The system needs to be well supported by a network of primary public health and clinical/medical diagnostic laboratories that are coordinated by a national public health reference laboratory with real-time and harmonious communication between the laboratories and epidemiological surveillance units."

    "RNA preparation and next-generation sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from 5 \u03eb 10 6 cells per sample using a mirVana kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX), and the quality and concentration of the RNA were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples were submitted for sequencing to IlluminaFastTrack Sequencing Services (Hayward, CA). cDNA libraries were generated using Illumina mRNA-SEQ kit. The quality and concentration of these libraries were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The libraries were clonally amplified on a cluster generation station using Illumina version 4 cluster generation reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 300,000 (300K)/mm 2 in a single channel of a flow cell. The resulting libraries were then sequenced on a Genome Analyzer IIx using Illumina version 4.0 sequencing reagents which generated single reads of 75 nucleotides (nt). Image analysis, base calling, and error estimation were performed using Illumina Analysis Pipeline (version 2.6)."

No differences were observed in 3CLpro over this time. Sequences also remained unchanged in CT02, CT16 and CT12 from the times of presentation to necropsy. The viral 3CLpro from lung and spleen of cat CT10, which relapsed twice over 8 months and retreated, had an Asp-to-Ser substitution at position 25 and a Lys-to-Asp substitution at position 260 compared with virus from pre-treatment abdominal fluid. The exact effects of these mutations on protease function are currently being investigated. It is reported that genetic evolution of viral protein quasi-species arises over time in patients chronically infected with an RNA virus (HCV) and may lead to sporadic amino acid changes. 11",

Cat CT04 presented with significant weight loss of 30%. It gained weight after each round of treatment, began to lose weight shortly before each disease relapse, and regained and added to its weight after each treatment. It regained all its lost weight after 9.3 months off and on treatment (4.8 kg to 7.19 kg).

These include the \"big three\"-HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria-which account for 10% of all deaths. They also include emerging diseases such as Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Infections are caused by microbial pathogens from different domains of the tree of life-viruses, bacteria, or eukaryotes. All share the ability to colonize their hosts and cause pathology through their interactions with host cells.",

Another is to reduce or eliminate an existing infection with drugs that kill the infectious agent and/or enhance the immune response.",
    "Thus it appears that developing drugs that target host components is a viable strategy to combat infectious diseases, and this may prove complementary to the traditional approach of developing antimicrobials that target pathogen proteins. Although potential drawbacks of such a strategy include the risk of toxicity to the host, potential benefits may include an increased flexibility in developing combination therapies and a reduced capacity of the pathogens to become resistant to drug treatment."

    "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease in cats and some non-domestic felids that is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) 1 . This virus is included in the Coronaviridae family, a group of enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses 1 . Although FIP manifests itself in effusive or noneffusive forms, the basic lesion is the same, a pyogranulomatous inflammation and vasculitis 1 . Testing by immunofluorescence assay, ELISA, electron microscopy, RT-PCR and sequence analysis may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of FIP 1,2 .",
    "Since 2006, some ferrets with clinical signs and visceral lesions similar to those in cats with FIP have been reported [2] [3] [4] [5] . All cases in these reports were found in either Europe or the United States, and no case had been reported i n J a p a n .

This paper describes the histopathological features of our ferret, which is the first reported case of feline infectious peritonitis-like pyogranuloma in ferrets in Japan.",
    "Fecal-oral exposure seems to be the likely route of transmission for this coronavirus 2 . All the ferrets we purchased were bred in individual cages, and the ferret in this report had a short latency period in our laboratory. Accordingly, we consider that the risk of infection in our laboratory is low but it is unclear how the ferret became infected. To our knowledge, this disease resembling FIP in a ferret has not previously been reported in Japan, and therefore this is apparently the first case in Japan."

    "Human infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae, was first reported in 2012 [1]. Since then, more than 2,200 laboratory-confirmed cases have been described with an estimated 35.5% case-fatality rate [2] . Middle East countries appeared to be mainly affected by the life-threatening pathogenicity of the virus, but some exported cases were also reported in Asia, Europe, and the United States of America [1,3]. Given zoonotic transmission of the virus from dromedary camels to humans and its lethality in humans [1], vaccines and/or antivirals should be prepared, but no approved medical countermeasures are available, yet.",
    "In line with the pathogenic mechanisms reported with MERS-CoV [4], such as acute respiratory symptoms and local immune responses, viral antagonism against host innate immune responses may be of great significance in terms of the pandemic potential and host range restriction of the virus. Viral antagonism had been already described for , and, of the MERS-CoV proteins, protein 4a was suggested responsible for its role against RNA-dependent protein kinase-mediated antiviral immunity and activation of retinoic acidinducible gene I and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 of host cells [6, 7] . The antagonistic effects of MERS-CoV protein 4b were also demonstrated against nuclear factor-\u03baB-dependent immunity and RNase L activation of host cells [8, 9] . As shown for influenza and Zika viruses [10, 11] , the species-specific effects of viral antagonism of MERS-CoV on J Vet Sci.",
    "The 4a and 4b proteins of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been described for their antagonism on host innate immunity. However, unlike clustering patterns of the complete gene sequences of human and camel MERS-CoVs, the 4a and 4b protein coding regions did not constitute species-specific phylogenetic groups. Moreover, given the estimated evolutionary rates of the complete, 4a, and 4b gene sequences, the 4a and 4b proteins might be less affected by species-specific innate immune pressures. These results suggest that the 4a and 4b proteins of MERS-CoV may function against host innate immunity in a manner independent of host species and/or evolutionary clustering patterns."

    "Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been widely used as human and veterinary drugs, especially for the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases in domestic animals, poultry, and fish [21] . FQs act through inhibition of DNA-gyrase, abolishing activity by interfering with the DNA rejoining reaction [3, 14] . The widespread use of FQs has led to contaminating residues in foodstuffs derived from treated animals, which can induce unwanted reactions such as erythema, burning, and itching in humans and animals [25] . Furthermore, antibiotics released into the natural ecosystem can modify the local environmental microbiota by changing the composition or activity [1, 23] . Many regulatory agencies have established a maximum residue limit for FQs in milk, meat, and other foods [5, 6] .

    "The habitat type classification is based on 11 distinct manually curated habitat terms (e.g. air, freshwater, marine, host-associated human, host-associated plants, terrestrial soil) previously described (11) . This classification allows the selection of mVCs from samples that belong to a single habitat type ( Figure 3C ).",
    "In order to alleviate some of the existing resource limitations, and enable the community to access and analyze an expanded version of the recently emerging viral genomics data we have developed IMG/VR, an integrated viral analysis system, within the Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome samples (IMG/M) data management system (20) .",
    "The ecosystem classification is based on a previously developed five-tier hierarchical classification system (21) . All metagenome data sets are organized in three main classes of the top ecosystem tier: engineered, environmental and hostassociated; and then further divided into sub-tiers called ecosystem category, ecosystem type, ecosystem subtype and specific ecosystem (31) ( Figure 3A) . Currently, 78.3% of the mVCs belong to environmental samples, while 16.3% and 5.4% correspond to host-associated and engineered, respectively. Users can navigate through all samples at once or just reduce the search to any specific ecosystem class or category (i.e 'Environmental Terrestrial' Figure 3B ), and from there, select particular types, subtypes or specific ecosystems."

    "The second and third analyses models were built using manual backward elimination in which nonsignificant variables were removed from the model one at a time starting with the variables with smallest magnitude of effect until all remaining variables had a P value of <.05. Covariates with a P value of <.2 at univariate analysis were assessed for significance with multivariable analysis; statistical significance was assessed at P < .05 for all multivariable models. Two-way interactions were assessed by inclusion of product terms for all variables remaining in the final additive models. For each univariate analysis, we used all available case information. For important variables in the HIV association and AF analyses that had substantial missing data, namely HIV infection status, we multiply imputed that variable as well as any variables that were incomplete and associated with HIV using chained equation multiple imputation over 10 iterations. When adjusting for respiratory viral coinfection in our models, we evaluated coinfection with each virus separately and also as a combined variable of coinfection with any of the tested viruses."

    "I nfectious diseases continue to be major health concerns worldwide: hepatitis C, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) are ongoing pandemics. A third of the world population is currently infected with the TB bacillus; millions of people are infected by influenza virus annually; and even though therapeutic drugs have slowed the threat of HIV-1, there is still no definitive cure or viable vaccine in sight. Although influenza virus vaccines provide protection, they must be reformulated annually, and the time lag from the spread of a pandemic virus to the availability of a vaccine is far too long. A universal vaccine against influenza virus is needed to limit high levels of morbidity and mortality. Newly emerging infectious diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, avian H5N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and dengue fever are a constant threat; and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella outbreaks in the food industry, are costly to society.",
    "The technologies, computational methods, and genome information needed to successfully implement this approach now exist. Technologies such as next-generation sequencing have opened the door to sequencing total transcriptomes, encompassing mi-croRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and mRNAs. This has raised the possibility that a previously unappreciated class of RNAs-the long noncoding RNAs-may play important roles in the host response to virus infection (4) . Proteomic technologies and accompanying informatics pipelines are evolving rapidly, with throughput and sensitivity approaching that of microarrays. Metabolomics, glycomics, lipidomics, and phosphoproteomics are young and comparatively undeveloped, but the promise is unlimited and the potential unprecedented. Moreover, the appropriate in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to generate useful pathogen-host interaction models are now available. Each of the four NIAID Systems Biology Centers has taken a unique approach to implementing this new research paradigm as outlined below.",
    "As highlighted in a recent review, systems biology is already making important contributions to cancer research (7) . The approach has been used to identify network motifs that can accurately predict the development of distant metastases in breast cancer patients-tumors that may develop years after the primary tumor and which frequently prove fatal. A network-centric approach has also identified specific oncogenes in certain types of B-cell lymphomas, and a multiscale mathematical model has been developed to test the efficacy of different radiation protocols, which has led to improvements in radiation therapies for colorectal cancer. The cancer field was one of the first research communities to aggressively embrace (and fund) the use of systems biology. We believe that the infectious disease community will build on the resulting substantial systems biology methodologies and insights to claim similar successes in the near future. We invite your thoughts and comments on this perspective."

    "It has traditionally been difficult to reach any kind of consensus concerning the definition of lipid rafts. However, in 2006 at the Keystone Symposium on Lipid Rafts and Cell Function in Colorado it was agreed that \"membrane rafts are small (10-200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol, and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through proteinprotein and protein-lipid interactions\" (Pike, 2006) . The long, saturated acyl chains of sphingolipids allow tight packing hence their juxtaposition with the kinked, unsaturated acyl chains of bulk membrane phospholipids leads to phase separation (Brown and London, 2000) . The cholesterol molecules can act as \"spacers,\" filling any gaps in sphingolipid packing (Simons and Ikonen, 1997) ."

    "However, despite these efforts, this novel virus was able to spread via infected people traveling within China and internationally. Furthermore, the mechanism of spillover that led to human infection is still uncertain, although it has all the hallmarks of a bat-origin SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) [4] . This leads us to two questions that we need to think \u204e Corresponding author. through even now to get ready to prevent the next 2019-nCoV-like pandemic:",
    "Dealing with the risk of future epidemics and pandemics requires a global effort. China is located within a major 'emerging disease hotspot' in Southeast Asia, but there is also a high risk of future diseases originating in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America [24] . Furthermore, the drivers of disease emergence are human activities that are expanding on a global scale, including deforestation, agricultural intensification and the wildlife trade. This has led to an exponential increase in the frequency of animal-human contact and likelihood of novel disease emergence and spread, suggesting that pandemics will become more frequent and more devastating in the future. These threats face all countries because once diseases emerge, they travel rapidly and freely through our global networks of travel and trade. We look forward to continued collaboration among scientists from China and the rest of the world, and to helping develop these new strategies to preventing the next pandemic.",
    "The first question is why did this virus spread so rapidly, and how can we deal with this risk? China has changed significantly since the emergence of SARS in 2002-2003. The economy has expanded, and many people have become wealthier, leading to an expansion of air and high-speed train travel. It is estimated that 3 billion individual journeys were planned during the Lunar New Year holiday (Chunyun), around 80 million of these being flights. The flight habits of Chinese citizens have changed alsowith many more flying internationally for business or tourism. In addition, since 2003, there has been an increase in travel between China and African countries, across Southeast Asia and into the New World as part of China's expansion of business and trade. This largely explains why the virus was able to spread out of China much more rapidly than SARS-CoV, which took over 2 months to move to Hong Kong then to the rest of the world."

    "In the replicative cycle of RNA viruses, the crucially important process of RNA-templated RNA synthesis is generally performed by an RNA-synthesizing complex of viral enzymes (1, 2) . Commonly, its core subunit is a single RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that drives the production of template strands for replication, new genome molecules, and-in many RNA virus groupsalso subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. This canonical RdRp is structurally conserved among RNA viruses and widely accepted to drive catalysis of phosphodiester bond formation via a well-established reaction mechanism involving two metal ions that are coordinated by aspartate residues in its motifs A and C (3) (4) (5) .",
    "Alignments of nsp8 sequences were made using Muscle (16) . Sequences used included the alphacoronaviruses human CoV 229E (NC_002645), human CoV NL63 (NC_005831), and bat CoV HKU8 (NC_010438); the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 (AY291315), mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV, NC_001849) and human CoV OC43 (NC_005147); and the gammacoronaviruses beluga whale CoV SW1 (NC010646), turkey CoV (NC_010800) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, AJ311317).",
    "The (functional) implications of these observations are not clear at present, but additional structural studies will likely be required to address these issues in detail, and gain insights that may aid in explaining the in vitro results presented here. Likely, such experiments will also offer further information regarding the residues that are involved in nucleotide positioning, Mg 2+ coordination and RdRp chemistry."

    "Infection with N. veterana might have followed inhalation in this dog, or alternatively, it might have followed ingestion of a contaminated penetrating foreign body, especially as the dog had a history of chewing sticks. The latter could also have explained the gagging behavior that was initially observed, which was otherwise unexplained. Additionally, culture of the focal jejunal mass grew Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as Candida, suggesting the possibility of perforation secondary to direct trauma or the inflammatory lesion itself. Histopathology of the jejunal mass revealed no evidence of plant or foreign material. Finally, it is possible that the organism was introduced by direct cutaneous inoculation, such as from a plant awn or other penetrating organic matter.",
    "Early detection and intervention is critical for patients with opportunistic infections secondary to immunosuppression. The identity of the organism to the species level in this dog was facilitated by MALDI-TOF MS and led to initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment sooner than traditional gene sequencing methods. The clinical utility of MALDI-TOF MS could have broader applications, particularly in animals with uncommon infections that are slow-growing and fastidious. In this case, successful treatment of disseminated N. veterana infection was possible with proper antimicrobial treatment and might be facilitated if underlying immunosuppressive drug treatment can be discontinued. ",
    "On initial evaluation at the VMTH (day 0), the dog was febrile (103.7\u00b0F) and had a moderate right thoracic limb lameness. Pain was elicited on palpation of the caudal thoracic vertebral spine, dorsal and lateral flexion of the cervical spine, and on elbow extension bilaterally. Mild joint effusion was noted in the tarsi, carpi, and elbows. A CBC was performed, and the only hematologic abnormality was leukocytosis (38,350 cells/uL, reference range, 6,000-13,000 cells/uL) characterized by a mature neutrophilia (36,433 cells/uL, reference range, 3,000-10,500 cells/uL). Arthrocentesis of the carpus, tarsus, elbow, and stifle revealed mild-to-moderate nondegenerate neutrophilic inflammation (neutrophils comprised 44-75% of total nucleated cells present). No microorganisms were observed. Examination of CSF obtained from the cisternal space revealed no abnormalities. No other diagnostics were performed. A diagnosis of primary immune-mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) was made, and an immunosuppressive dose of prednisone (1.1 mg/kg PO q12h) and tramadol (2.8 mg/kg PO q8-12h as needed) were prescribed at the time of discharge (day 2)."

    "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a translational recoding phenomenon historically associated with viruses and retrotransposons. A PRF signal stochastically redirects translating ribosomes into a new reading frame (i.e. by +1 or \u00c01 nt) and, in the typical viral context, these signals allow ribosomes to bypass the usual in-frame stop codon and continue synthesis of a C-terminally extended fusion protein.

    "Keeping the density of glycoprotein molecules on the virus surface low is a property of some viruses that is particularly pronounced for HIV-1, and is thought to provide a selective advantage during immune evasion [20] . It is unclear whether the drawback of reduction of virion infectivity, induced by 90K-mediated paucity of Env embedded in particles, is outweighed by improved immune escape. More work is warranted to fully understand the impact of 90K on HIV-1 infection."

    "A 12-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat was evaluated for a 3-week history of abdominal distension. Chyloabdomen secondary to pancreatic carcinoma was diagnosed. The cat was palliatively managed using rutin and a low-fat diet. The etiology, diagnosis and management of chyloabdomen are discussed.",
    "In human and veterinary medicine, chyloabdomen is a rare condition. It results from leakage of lipid-rich lymph into the peritoneal cavity, secondarily to obstruction or increased permeability of lymphatic vessels. In cats, it is believed to be mostly of neoplastic origin. Medical investigation relies on a systematic approach and definitive diagnosis often requires histopathological samples. This report describes the exploration and management of a chyloabdomen secondary to pancreatic carcinoma in a 12-year-old cat.",
    "Case Details A 12-year-old neutered female domestic shorthair cat was referred for evaluation of an abdominal effusion. The owners reported an abdominal distension of three weeks duration, with conservation of general demeanor and appetite. The referring veterinarian detected an abdominal effusion. A chyloabdomen was suspected, according to the gross appearance of the liquid. The cat was housed mainly outside. Her vaccination status was not up-to-date. On physical examination, the cat was bright, alert and normothermic. The body condition score was of 4 out of 9 and she had an unkempt haircoat. A marked abdominal distension was noted. No pain was elicited on abdominal palpation. Cardiorespiratory parameters were within normal limits. Abdominocentesis was performed under sedation. Approximately 300 mL of milky fluid were removed. Triglycerides content in the effusion was highly increased (102.84 g/L; reference range 0.30-1.60). The cytologic analysis of the fluid showed 1000 erythrocytes/\u00b5L and 1500 leukocytes/\u00b5L, including neutrophils (48%), monocytes (40%) and small, mature lymphocytes (12%). No bacteria nor neoplastic cells were visualized. Based on these findings, chyloabdomen was confirmed."

However if there has been a particular type of contact between a healthcare worker and a patient (for example intubation) or a patient is at high risk of severe or complicated infection, then further risk assessment is indicated with a view to offering prophylaxis. An alternative approach, if practical, is to monitor exposed persons and administer antiviral treatment when symptoms develop. When a vaccine becomes available the first priority should be to immunize healthcare staff."

    "Creatine kinase (normal range 24-173 IU/L) and aldolase (1.0-7.5 IU/L) were determined using an automated kinetic assay. Leukocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were also assessed. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were evaluated using the Westergren and nephelometry methods, respectively. Autoantibodies against cellular components were determined with indirect immunofluorescence using Hep-2 cells as the substrate. Autoantibody anti-Jo-1 was determined using the Western blotting method.",

    "Cell culture, transfection, and RNAi HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. To examine localization of GFP-or mCherry tagged proteins, cells were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate at \ue07a80% confluency and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection contained 400 ng of DNA. Transfected cells were examined 24 h after transfection. For esiRNA experiments, cells were seeded at 50% confluency and transfected using 10 nM of each esiRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Cells were examined 48-72 h after transfection. For RNAi rescue experiments, cells were transfected with esiRNA, incubated for \ue07a36 h until cells had reached \ue07a80% confluency, then transfected with mCherry-Sec61\ue062 and various GFP-tagged EndoU constructs. For siRNA experiments, cells were seeded at 50% confluency and transfected with 5 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Cells were examined 72 h after transfection.",

    "The resulting reads were reduced to unique reads (we assumed that all perfectly matching reads were the result of PCR duplication) using a custom Perl script. Reads were the aligned to the X. laevis rRNA precursor (gi|65056, gi|64487, gi|65094, gi|65095) using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) . Reads aligning to X. laevis rRNA were subtracted using a custom Perl script. The remaining reads were aligned to a draft assembly of the X. laevis genome (7.0 downloaded from Xenbase, June 2013) using tophat2. Reads aligning to transcripts were counted using Cufflinks."

The largest casualty in this earthquake was caused by the destruction of mud, mortar or brick rural buildings that simplest technical criteria had not been considered, and non-structural parts such as walls and false ceilings had severe damage. Geological features of the earthquake, the facilities of the area and damage to humans are summarized in Table 1 .",
    "The following criteria have been used for comparison of earthquakes: The first criterion is the comparison of seismology, geotechnical and texture data; the second criterion is the magnitude of the human damage caused by 3 earthquakes; the third criterion: the notification process and rapid warning system of the medical emergency services system; the fourth criterion: the coordination and pre-hospital Emergency system's surge capacity program; the fifth criterion: distribution system and transfer of patients and injured."

    "The global prevalence of the dengue virus (DENV) has grown dramatically in recent decades, and it is now endemic in .100 countries, with some 2.5 billion people at risk of infection. Dengue is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that can be subdivided into the 4 major serotypes (DEN-1-DEN-4). Most dengue infections either are asymptomatic or lead to a self-limiting febrile illness, dengue fever. In some cases the illness is more severe, leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with severe plasma leakage and bleeding that can be life threatening."

    "Data collection. Data were collected using a semistructured questionnaire. The questionnaire was constructed by a focus group including 4 consultants from the community and family medicine. Closedended and open-ended questions were utilized, including questions measuring demographics, level of knowledge, practice and attitude relating to public health preventive measures at points of entry. The questionnaire was constructed in Arabic language. The questionnaire was piloted on 20 individuals )10 males and 10 females( and additional questions and choices were conducted according to the piloting findings. All questionnaires were filled out during personal interviews. All interviews were conducted by 3 trained interviewers. There was no audio recording of conducted interviews. However, notes of the open-ended responses were taken during the interviews and were transcribed by the interviewers."

    "Interestingly, in a previous study [10] , hexon-modified virus with incorporation of the His 6 peptide into HVR8 was reported to be viable. Our result with HVR8 is contradictory, evidently due to the differences in the peptides sequences and their lengths. Further, while the two studies are made with changes within HVR8, the specific locations of the incorporations differ as well. Notably our study uses a foreign sequence inserted between Asn437 and Gly438 ( Fig. 1) , while Wu et al. [10] placed His 6 between Pro431 and Trp439 substituting for 7 aa residues of hexon.",
    "The virus was amplified by passaging in HEK 293 cells and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation [23] . The concentration of virus particles (VP) in purified virus preparations was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm as previously described [24] , whereas numbers of infectious particles (IP) were determined by the tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 ) method [25] . ",
    "Human adenovirus type 5 (hAd5) vector has been shown to be an excellent vaccine delivery system in humans and animals [1, 2] . The replication-defective (E1-deleted) and replication-competent (E3-deleted) hAd5 have both been used as vaccine delivery vectors. For biosafety concerns, a replication-defective hAd5 is considered to be more suitable for vaccination. Replication-defective vectors may also have deletion in the E3 region to increase the amount of foreign DNA that can be inserted. Conventional strategy for the expression of a vaccine antigen by adenoviral vector includes insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the E1 region. This antigen is expressed as transgene after the infection of permissive cells with recombinant adenovirus."

The RVP Fast assay incorporates multiplex RT-PCR using primers with universal tags. The amplified product is hybridized to a bead array conjugated to specific probes. Detection is performed using a streptavidin-Rphycoerythrin conjugate. Each bead population detects a unique viral target by hybridisation to a specific anti-tag. A signal (median fluorescence intensity) is generated for each bead population [40] . These fluorescence values are analyzed by using xTAG \u00ae data analysis software for RVP Fast (TDAS RVP Fast) to establish the presence or absence of viral targets in each sample. A recent version of the xTAG RVP Fast panel (RVP v2) is CE marked and identifies 19 viral types and subtypes, which now includes Flu A(H1N1)pdm09."

HBeAg, a non-particulate viral protein, is conventionally considered a marker of HBV replication (30) . This is the only antigen of HBV, which can cross the placenta (31), leading to the specific unresponsiveness of helper T cells to the hepatitis B capsid protein (HBcAg) and HBeAg in newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers (32) . HBeAg is tolerated in utero and acts as a tolerogen after birth (33) . Thus, perinatal transmission is frequent when mothers are HBeAg-positive, whereas it occurs significantly less frequently when mothers are HBeAg-negative (34) (35) (36) ."

Clustering is a means of partitioning data so that data points inside a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to points outside a cluster. In the context of molecular simulation, this means grouping similar conformations together. Similarity is determined by a distance metric -the smaller the distance, the more similar the structures. One commonly used distance metric is coordinate root mean square deviation (RMSD). Application of this procedure resulted in four main clusters, from which one centroid conformation PDB structure was chosen for subsequent molecular docking."

    "Overall, intricate trafficking of membrane proteins regulates specific cellular activities, such as nutrient uptake and signal transduction, and collectively allows cells to rapidly respond to their surroundings. While providing a means for large molecules to access an otherwise impermeable cell, the endocytic network is also exploited as a portal of entry for pathogens. Many pathogenic enveloped viruses infecting humans, including Influenza A virus (IAV), Dengue virus, and Ebola virus, adhere to a life cycle that relies on endosomal movement and maturation. The progressive acidification that occurs during the transition from early endosomes to late endosomes triggers fusion between viral and endosomal membranes, allowing cytoplasmic access and the initiation of viral replication (7) . Endosomes are thus situated at a crucial cellular threshold, and, as a result, they are equipped with elements of the cell-intrinsic antiviral immune response (8) .",

    "In this two-part series of reviews, we have invited experts in their fields to contribute articles on the status of vaccine research and development for emerging pathogens. This topic has been brought into sharp focus in recent years following significant outbreaks of viral diseases such as those causing severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as devastating outbreaks of diseases caused by the Ebola, Marburg, Zika and Lassa fever viruses, to name only a few examples. Additionally, bacterial infections leading to bubonic and pneumonic plague, most notably in Madagascar in 2018, as well as malaria in many tropical countries, melioidosis in south east Asia and tularaemia in northern Europe and North America, have incurred significant morbidity and mortality. In this review series, the life cycle of these pathogens and the epidemiology of disease have been reviewed in the context of potential points of intervention for the prevention of human infection. Many of the emerging pathogens are zoonoses and, as such, there is scope for intervention at the animal/insect/environmental reservoir. Other pathogens covered in this review series are considered to be re-emerging, such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis."

The IBV used in these experiments was adapted to growth in monkey cells by nine consecutive passages of egggrown virus at low multiplicity of infection in Vero cells, and was obtained from B. Sefton (The Salk Institute). Tissue culture supernatant from infected Vero cells was used as the inoculum to infect COS-I cells for radiolabeling and inununofluorescence. The multiplicity of infection was approximately 0.1, and infected cells were assayed for IBV-speciflc polypeptides at 29 and 48 h postinfection."

    "As viral diseases vary greatly in duration and severity, the safety threshold of an antiviral nucleoside/tide needs to be considered in the context of its efficacy and treatment duration. For example, compounds to treat acute and deadly viral infections such as Ebola would likely have different safety criteria than drugs used to control chronic infections such as HIV-1 and HBV. Existing nucleoside/tides are routinely screened against emerging viruses, and it is possible that a compound that failed to achieve an adequate therapeutic window against one virus may be suitable for treating other viral infections.",
    "Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have played significant roles in antiviral therapies and are valued for their impressive potency and high barrier to resistance. They have been approved for treatment of herpes simplex virus-1, HIV, HBV, HCV, and influenza, and new drugs are being developed for the treatment of RSV, Ebola, coronavirus MERS, and other emerging viruses. However, this class of compounds has also experienced a high attrition rate in clinical trials due to toxicity. In this review, we discuss the utility of different biochemical and cell-based assays and provide recommendations for assessing toxicity liability before entering animal toxicity studies.",
    "In certain cases, testing in a specific cell assay is warranted. For example, a number of the first-generation HIV nucleoside analogs showed myelosuppressive effects. As a result, the FDA recommended evaluating this toxicity on the growth of human bone marrow progenitor cells in colony formation assays. 37 The importance of measuring cellular TP levels A nucleoside/tide analog's cytotoxicity is often directly related to its cellular level of the active TP metabolite. BMS-986094 and IDX184 are both 2 0 CMe guanosine nucleotide prodrugs, but the former formed >37-fold higher TP, and this correlated with its significantly higher toxicity. 18 Some nucleoside analogs are poorly phosphorylated in cells, such as balapiravir. Even though it is a specific inhibitor of POLRMT, balapiravir showed little or no toxicity in a large panel of cell lines and primary cells tested, but development of this compound was stopped at Phase II due to toxicity."

    "Recent global outbreaks of EIDs, such as Ebola or Zika virus (ZIKV) diseases, reminded the world of the imminent threat of unexpected pathogens. EIDs can result from infectious agents that have recently appeared or have existed, but are rapidly increasing in incidence. 14, 15 Major pathogens include highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV), ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",
    "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are defined as newly appearing infections in a population or diseases that have previously existed, but are rapidly emerging in incidence or geographic range. 1, 2 EIDs are often initiated by pathogens with a change in pathogenicity, and these emerging pathogens are highly likely to be zoonotic, with a broad range of hosts or vector-borne. [3] [4] [5] New human pathogens are especially likely to continue emerging, mainly from mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, an effective global surveillance system for novel pathogens is needed. Due to the diverse nature of antigenic variation of emerging pathogens and their various strategies to evade the immune system, EIDs continue to pose difficult challenges to clinicians, public health profes-sionals, and researchers globally.",
    "As summarized above, in addition to virus genetic variation, complex environmental factors, including ecological and behavioral influences, can be important contributing components of the recent emergence of viral diseases. Recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks have shown that the world is unprepared to detect local outbreaks and respond quickly enough to prevent them from becoming global pandemics. Given the great concern for public health owing to the speed and increased volume of global transportation, the ability to rapidly develop and deliver vaccines when new 'unknown' diseases emerge offers our best hope to outpace EID outbreaks, save lives, and avert disastrous economic consequences."

    "Previous studies have characterized Sir2 protein as a pro-longevity factor for replicative lifespan in yeast [15, 20, 26, 46, 53] . Sir2 orthologs also extended lifespan in other organism species including Caenorhabditis elegans and flies [43, 50] . Because it has been suggested that the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on lifespan are mediated by Sir2 orthologs in higher eukaryotes [4, 7, 8, 44] , sirtuins received significant public interest. Sirtuins are a family of highly conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent protein deacylases found in eukaryotes. In humans, there are seven sirtuin homologs (SIRT1-7). All sirtuins require NAD + as a cofactor, making them prone to regulation by fluctuations in NAD+ conditions, thus linking them to cellular metabolism in response to nutritional and environmental perturbations such as caloric restriction. Of all the sirtuins, SIRT1 has received the most attention in relation to longevity. It deacetylates key histone residues involved in transcription regulation, and multiple non-histone proteins including p53, FOXO1/3, PGC-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB [11, 37, 51] . By targeting these proteins, SIRT1 is able to regulate numerous vital signaling pathways, including DNA repair, apoptosis, muscle and fat differentiation, neurogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, hormone secretion, cell stress responses and circadian rhythms [3, 37, 42] . In general, SIRT1 activation triggers nuclear transcription programs that enhance metabolic efficiency and up-regulate mitochondrial oxidative metabolism accompanying resistance to oxidative stress [13, 16] .",
    "To our knowledge, there are few published studies measuring SIRT1 level in companion animals [17, 18, 30, 31] . In dogs, there are two reports: one is in association with the p53 mutations status in a dog with multiple tumors [31] , and the other evaluated SIRT1 gene expression in a cell line in relation to coronavirus infection [30] . The reason for the low number of studies is, at least in part by, the lack of antibodies to detect canine SIRT1."

In the case of mouse-hepatitis virus (MHV), an increase of morbidity and mortality in infected mice has been associated with memory T cells. 76 Although no direct evidence have shown that SARS-CoV-specific T cell responses contribute to immunopathology in SARS, it is a question that needs to be further addressed.

    "Nanomicelles stabilize peptides in active biological form (\u03b1-helix), which is preferred for ligand-receptor interactions, and prevents rapid peptide degradation in vivo, thereby prolonging bioactivity [25, 26] . Unlike surfactant micelles, a low critical micellar concentration (\u223c1 \u00b5M) of these nanoparticles prevents their disintegration upon dilution in biological fluids. Importantly, the PEG 2000 moiety of SSM confers steric hindrance in the circulation, while their nanosize mitigates renal clearance and extravasation from intact microvessels. This, in turn, prolongs the circulation time of drug-loaded nanomicelles and promotes preferential extravasation from hyperpermeable lung microcirculation, the hallmark of ALI, into the injured lung.",
    "To effectively block the expression of TREM1, we developed LP17 peptide nanomedicine, LP17-SSM. LP17 is the soluble TREM1 or extracellular component which binds and inhibits signaling through TREM1 [5] . Control SSMs were prepared by using scrambled peptide. For the TREM1 blocking peptide, LP17, circular dichroism confirmed that there was a significant increase in \u03b1-helicity in the presence of SSM compared to the free peptides in normal saline. This indicated the presence of peptide-micelle interaction where the peptides changed from a random conformation in saline to a more ordered helical structure when associated with SSM. To determine in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy and the dose-response effect of LP17-SSM, we established the dose and time-dependent effects as with GLP-1-SSM [16] . Mice were given one dose of LP17 nanomedicine, nanoscrambled peptide, PBS, or LP17 subcutaneously in a single dose prior to LPS challenge. The ALI animal model used was based on previous publications [16, 37] . Mice were challenged with aerosolized LPS by nebulization (8 mg LPS dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at the concentration of 1 mg/mL) administered via DeVilbiss disposable nebulizer (at the continuous air flow rate of 10 ft 3 /h) over 1 h to induce ALI. The animals were sacrificed 12 h after LPS nebulization.",
    "Studies with other nanomicellar preparations such as 17-AAG, curcumin, and PPAR\u03b3 agonists for treatment of ALI/ARDS are currently ongoing in our laboratory [8] . Together, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of translating the use of these nanomicellar preparations for translational human studies to the clinics to treat this devastating disease. We hypothesize that combinatorial administration of nanomicelles or use of more pleiotropic agents that modulate multiple signaling pathways will prove to be more potent; however, further studies are needed to optimize the administration of the nanopreparations. ",
    "We have also tested the efficacy of TREM1 nanomicellar peptides in a model of LPSinduced sepsis and lung injury. TREM proteins are a family of immunoglobulin cell surface receptors expressed on myeloid cells. TREM1 was the first TREM identified, and blockade of TREM1 has been shown to improve survival in animal models of sepsis [33] . We have extensively studied the mechanisms by which TREM1 amplifies inflammation [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Previous studies where TREM1 blockade was used therapeutically in models of sepsis and infection employed fusion proteins (soluble or extracellular components of TREM1) [23, 33] . These peptides are limited by their short half-life and therefore may not be practical for therapeutic purposes."

However, anticancer programs have neglected the possibility of evaluating the effects of investigational small molecules on this interplay. Preclinical trials are typically performed on pathogen-free mice with xenotransplanted human tumour cells, and early stages of clinical trials focus on tumour regression and long-term survival without taking into account the potential impact of the chemotherapeutic agent in conjunction with underlying or overt viral infection of the patients. Our study sets an example for addressing the impact of anticancer molecules on the microbe-host interplay and the therapeutic outcome in a background of microbial infection.

Exploring the true determinants of pathogen detection would have required a systematic and universal testing strategy and, for this reason, it was out of the scope of this study.",
    "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalisation worldwide. Mortality rates for patients hospitalised with CAP approach 30%, especially in those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Diagnostic testing in CAP has the potential to improve individual patient management, reducing the risk of clinical failure and death, and to generate epidemiological data, informing the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy. Unfortunately, these advantages are counterbalanced by high healthcare costs associated with diagnostic testing and low sensitivity of these tests to identify pathogens causing CAP [5, 6] .",
    "We performed a secondary analysis of an international, multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study using the Global Initiative for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia (GLIMP) database [13] . GLIMP was conducted among 222 hospitals in 54 countries over 4 days, with 1 day per month randomly selected during March, April, May and June 2015. All adult patients (aged >18 years) hospitalised for CAP at the participating centres during the four study days were screened by GLIMP investigators and included in this secondary analysis. Patients hospitalised with a diagnosis of hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia were excluded. The GLIMP coordinating centre was located at the University of Texas Health San Antonio (San Antonio, TX, USA). The coordinating centre received expedited project approval by the institutional review board (number HSC20150184E). The review board waived the need for receipt of informed consent due to the nature of the study. Institutional review board approval was obtained by the site investigators at each individual centre. A detailed description of the GLIMP organisation and methodologies has been previously published [13] .",
    "In conclusion, our understanding of the aetiologies of CAP among hospitalised adults is scarce, limiting the accuracy of empirical antimicrobial regimens. Disease severity and geography are associated with differences in testing approaches. The wide discordance between IDSA/ATS/ERS recommendations and real-life testing strategies should prompt future studies to evaluate the clinical and economic implications of different testing approaches and investigate the reasons for these differences."

    "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) occurs in animals with cloven hooves. FMD viruses (FMDVs) are a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [16] and belong to the genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae [4] ; the size of the virus genome is approximately 8.5 kb. These viruses are classified into seven serotypes-A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3and more than 60 subtypes [16] . FMD outbreaks cause a reduction in the productivity of infected animals (e.g., pigs, cows, lambs, and goats) [2, 3] . The culling of infected animals and events such as environmental contamination and loss of revenue from the livestock have emerged as important socioeconomic issues [21, 23] ."

Two strategies for its prevention and eradication have been widely adopted. Mass slaughter of animals at risk of infection has been used extensively in developed countries but economic factors have made vaccination more popular in developing countries where the prevalence of FMD is high (Li et al., 2010) . Most countries in the European Union and North America have controlled the disease by slaughtering infected animals and those that may have been exposed, but it remains endemic in many African, Asian, and South American countries (Bayry et al., 2001) . Although the slaughter policy has been highly successful in limiting the extent of outbreaks and eliminating the infection, it has important negative aspects."

Of the 66 fecal samples tested, four (6.06%) were positive for CDV, eight (12.12%) were positive for CPV, and four (6.06%) were positive for CaKoV. Among these, two were mixed infections of CDV and CPV and one was a mixed infection of CPV and CaKoV, detected with the one-step multiplex PCR/RT-PCR. The results for the commercial CDV/CPV Ag Test Kit and the traditional simplex RT-PCR were three (4.55%) samples positive for CDV, seven (10.61%) positive for CPV, and four (6.06%) positive for CaKoV; among these positive samples, one was a mixed infection of CPV and CaKoV. For the CDV and CPV, the positive rate of clinical samples tested by one-step multiplex PCR/RT-PCR was higher than the commercial CDV/CPV Ag Test Kit. The main reason may be that the nucleic acid detection methods are more sensitive than the antigen detection methods, But statistically, we cannot conclude that the multiplex PCR/RT-PCR established in present study is more sensitive than the commercial CDV/CPV Ag Test Kit or the traditional simplex RT-PCR. The more clinical tests need further to be done to evaluate it. For one sample, the CPV was positive tested by CPV Ag Test Kit, but negative by the "

Should a scenario arise where this coronavirus spreads more broadly across China, we evaluate how patterns of international disease transmission could change.",
    "A novel coronavirus emerging from Wuhan, China in late December 2019 is currently spreading to other provinces in mainland China and international destinations across East Asia. At the time of writing, cases have been confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau and multiple cities in Guangdong province, with more than 500 cases confirmed across China. 1 Furthermore, several cases have spread internationally via air travel 2 to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. A recent modelling study concluded that for these international exportations to be observed, the outbreak in China should be substantially larger than is reflected by confirmed case counts. 3 Currently, many public health interventions are based on scenarios where Wuhan is the primary source of new cases. 4 While there are currently no documented transmission chains outside of the Wuhan region, should a scenario arise where this novel coronavirus spreads more broadly to and within other Chinese cities, we evaluated how global patterns of disease dispersion might change.",
    "We analyzed international airline passenger trips from the following 10 cities: Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Chengdu, Xiamen, Haikou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong There currently are numerous unknowns including the presumed animal origins of the virus, the efficiency of humanto-human transmission, an understanding of the full spectrum of clinical illness and an incomplete epidemiological picture of disease activity in China. While our analysis does not account for the potential effects of the epidemic on changing travel behaviours, it reflects worldwide flows of airline travellers at the same time of year in 2019, including the Lunar New Year in February 2019. At the time of writing, flights and land transportation in and out of Wuhan have been suspended, and it is uncertain how this will impact disease transmission in China. Our findings could support public health planning and readiness for different scenarios should the current epidemic spread more widely across mainland China and neighbouring cities."

We limited the studies into those in humans and excluded reports published as review articles, letters, case studies, editorials, conference abstracts, vaccination trials or family-based studies. After eliminating duplicate listings and only considering articles in full text, a total of 44 peer-reviewed original studies were selected for full text review. Full article review resulted in the further exclusion of 8 reports that were not documenting the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV (i.e., no association studies), examining only a small number of travellers as a case report (n=2 subjects), reporting seasonal influenza alone, reviewing already reported cases (MERS-CoV), or simply documenting national surveys. A bibliography search of the remaining articles identified two additional studies.

    "Autophagy has inexorably been linked to the host cellular response to diverse intracellular pathogens. Indeed, autophagy frequently serves as an innate mechanism that sequesters or clears offending pathogens from the host cell, termed xenophagy. In response to infection, pathogen-and damage-associated molecular patterns stimulate pattern recognition receptors, which then activate ATG proteins to induce autophagy or promote recognition of the microbe by the LC3-positive autophagosome (Deretic et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, the autophagy trafficking process can be subverted by pathogens that have adapted to avoid or use autophagy to their own benefit (Deretic and Levine, 2009 ). One example is poliovirus, which utilizes LC3 to promote its nonlytic viral release, potentially by the fusion of LC3-positive vesicles containing poliovirus with the plasma membrane (Bird et al., 2014) .",
    "During Brucella abortus infection, multiple ATG proteins implicated in the early steps of autophagosome initiation, such as ULK1 and Beclin 1, are involved in the formation of a B. abortus-containing vacuole (BCV) with autophagic features (aBCV), which promotes bacterial proliferation. Double-membrane crescents reminiscent of the autophagosome engulf BCVs late in infection but do not degrade or clear the bacteria. Instead, ULK1, Beclin 1, and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity are all required for the conversion of BCVs into aBCVs. However, the ATG conjugation pathways involved in autophagosome elongation play no role in aBCV formation. Furthermore, these aBCVs facilitate bacterial release and infection of neighboring cells, demonstrating that very specific components of autophagosome initiation promote B. abortus infection (Starr et al., 2012) ."

In addition, an EBOV disease is currently ongoing in Western Africa [4] and is associated with 25 791 cases and 10 689 deaths (as of 15 April 2015) [5] . In contrast, RESTV is an Asian ebolavirus, which might be apathogenic in immunocompetent humans [6] . African [7] and Asian ebolaviruses [8] infect bats, which serve as a natural reservoir, and a related filovirus, Lloviu virus (LLOV; genus Cuevavirus), was identified in a European bat [9] . Thus, zoonotic transmission of ebolaviruses to humans can pose a significant threat to public health, and understanding virus-host cell interactions might yield insights into viral spread and pathogenesis and provide a basis for developing antiviral strategies."

    "In conclusion, the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a webbased and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes.",
    "The tool uses a novel and dynamic aligner, AGA, to allow submitted sequences to be queried against reference genomes, using both nucleotide and amino acid similarity scores. This allows accurate identification of other coronavirus species and the tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally. It also performs detailed analysis of the coding regions and proteins. Moreover, it can easily be updated to add new phylogenetic clusters if new outbreaks arise or if the classification nomenclature changes. The tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as all the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak sequences",
    "We developed and released the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing tool as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of January 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of COVID-19 infections. This tool allows the analysis of whole or partial viral genomes within minutes. It accepts assembled genomes in FASTA format or raw NGS data in FASTQ format from Illumina, Ion Torrent, PACBIO or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) can be submitted to the Genome Detective Virus Tool (Vilsker et al., 2019) to automatically assemble the consensus genome prior to executing the Coronavirus Typing Tool. User effort is minimal, and a user can submit multiple FASTA sequences at once."

    "The paper is important in two respects. First, the recombination event may have resulted in the evolution of a new lineage of MERS-CoV with different transmission properties. Additional field work in epidemiology and studies of recombinant viruses in culture and in animal models will be required to determine whether this proves true. However, the paper itself is evidence of an evolutionary advance in scientific expertise and transparency that is at least as important for microbiology and public health. China has come a long way since the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002/2003.",
    "Recombination is common in coronaviruses and has been implicated in the emergence of pathogenic coronaviruses in poultry, cats, and pigs (2, 3). It would not be surprising, therefore, if recombination were to occur in MERS-CoV and to result in enhanced transmission or virulence. Wang et al. clearly demonstrate through bootstrap scanning and single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses that the viruses found in South Korea and China represent a recombinant virus that contains a clade B group 3 coronavirus sequence in the 5= portion of the genome and a clade B group 5 coronavirus sequence in the 3= end of the genome, with a site of recombination between nucleotide positions 17206 and 17311, a region that spans the junction between the ORF1a and S genes. They note that the recombination is evident in recent strains identified in human cases of MERS in Saudi Arabia and estimate that the recombination occurred in Saudi Arabia in the later months of 2014."

    "This review will focus on the therapeutics currently available for treating viral hepatitis of all forms. In addition, the potential of new therapeutics and targeted inhibitor-based therapies against viral membrane-penetrating peptides and viroporins, a group of virally encoded proteins involved in facilitating replication and other specific steps in the viral life cycle, are also discussed.",
    "We further investigated the non-structural 2B protein of HAV, which was found to contain a stretch of 60 residues in its C-terminus, and which has viroporin-like activity. 97 A combination of crosslinking studies, biophysical assays and simulation was employed to determine that 2B probably forms dimers and generates ;3 nm pores in membranes. The resulting alteration of membrane permeability is thought to be essential for HAV replication. It is probable that inhibition of the membrane activity of 2B would negatively impact the viral replication process. Thus, a treatment regimen against HAV, which includes a combination therapy targeting VP4 and 2B, could be a very promising and effective approach.",
    "Given the essential roles played by viroporins and viral membrane penetrating peptides in enhancing several aspects of the virus life cycle, targeted inhibitor therapy holds promise for development of virus-specific drugs. Establishing the commonalities between the structures and functions of these membrane active components might make it easier to design small molecule inhibitors. Finally, given the promise of p7-based therapy against HCV, it is essential to pinpoint such potential candidates in other hepatotropic viruses, in order to expand therapy options against chronic and acute viral hepatitis.

    "RNA interference (RNAi) is a short, double-strand RNA induced-process that can target the mRNA of a specific sequence for degradation [9, 10] . Post-transcriptional gene silencing can be mediated by endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs), exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). RNAi technology is recognized as a promising, novel nucleic acid-based tool for use against various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. RNAi reagents have also been reported to potently and specifically inhibit the replication of different viruses, including HIV, HBV [11] , HSV [12] , SAR-CoV [13] , influenza virus [14, 15] , coxsackievirus [16] and others. Thus, the development of RNAis as possible antiviral agents for hantavirus infection is of considerable interest [17] .",

    "Such issues are not limited to infectious diseases. For example, while it has long been known that human exposure to unsafe levels of methylmercury is predominantly through dietary consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish, recent technological advances in high-resolution mass spectroscopy now provide a means to \"fingerprint\" the contributing mercury and determine its source [26] . For example, many locations are impacted by both point-source releases as well as nearly ubiquitous atmospheric fallout of mercury. This new fingerprinting capability has extended the capacity to determine which mercury sources contribute to fish, wildlife, and human exposures, thereby informing environmental decision makers of the most effective means to reduce such exposures.",

    "As a demonstration of an interconnected system, bats contribute up to 50 billion USD annually to the United States of America (US) agricultural economy through their part in insect control [4] . However, the emergence of white-nose syndrome has resulted in the death of over 6 million bats in North America resulting in a marked decrease in insect control [3] . Additionally, while bats are critical components of world ecosystems, they are also potential reservoirs of zoonotic viruses, including rabies, Marburg virus, and Nipah virus [27] . In today's age of dynamic changes in the emergence of infectious diseases associated with increasing interactions among humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, the need to consider these interactions fully becomes crucial for effective management that balances the needs of humans, animals, and the environment."

After antigen retrieval with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0), endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 . Then the sections were added with the appropriate antibody at appropriate dilution, then DAB staining solution was added. The sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and sealed. For immunofluorescence, antigen was retrieved with EDTA buffer (1 mM Tris/EDTA, pH 9.0) and endogenous fluorescence was eliminated with AutoFluo Quencher (Servicebio, Cat# G1221). The details of the antibodies used for immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry are given in Table S6 . Staining for each marker was scored using Image-pro plus (v.6.0). Integrated optical density (IOD) to area ratio was calculated for each marker to assess the staining intensity.",

    "Gammacoronavirus, and its genome encodes four structure proteins, spike glycoprotein (S), and membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2, 11] . New variant IBV strains in chickens continually emerge worldwide owing to the high mutation rate of its genome [4] . Various vaccines have been developed but the disease still occurs, because different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect and vaccine failures are often associated with the emergence of antigenic variants that differ from the vaccine viruses [9, 14] .",
    "All the tracheas from the slaughterhouses and from LC flocks were free of obviously gross lesions. Sixty-six flocks were sampled in the study period. Twenty tracheal samples per flock were taken for a total of 1,320 tracheal samples. The lower prevalence in LC flocks might be due to sampling differences, because 20 tracheas were sampled from each broiler flock but only one trachea was sampled from each LC flock.",
    "The samples that were IBV positive with the N-specific primer were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing using the S-specific primer, oligo5/rC3-r for genotyping [17] . The sequences of these primers are as follows: oligo5: 5\u2032-AAACT GAACA AAAGA CAGAC TTAG-3\u2032 (20251-20274, H120 numbering, GenBank accession number: FJ888351) and rC3-r: 5\u2032-(A/G) CAAT GTGTA ACAAA (T/C) ACT-3\u2032 (20655-20637). The same RT-PCR procedure was performed, except the annealing temperature for this primer set was 52\u00b0C. For LC field cases, one trachea from each flock was subjected to RT-PCR using the same method described for broilers. The prevalence differences among different seasons or chicken types were analyzed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests when any cell having expected value less than 5 [12] . The level of a significant difference was set at \u03b1 0.05.",
    "Eight tracheal samples positive for the IBV gene were selected for virus isolation, including S14, S41, S78, TC3, TC4, TC5, TC17 and TC38, using specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos (Animal Health Research Institute, Chiding, Taiwan). Tracheal samples were frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. After thawing, the organs were homogenized in sterile TPB in a 1:10 ratio. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was treated with a 1% mixture of ampicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel) for 1 hr at room temperature and then inoculated into the allantoic cavity of five 9-to-11-day-old SPF embryonated eggs. The eggs were incubated for 5 days and candled each day. After 5 days of incubation, the eggs were chilled at 4\u00b0C, and the allantoic fluid was collected. Each sample was given two blind passages before being considered negative. The presence of IBV in the allantoic fluid was detected using RT-PCR with NP1/NP2 primers [8] . Only two IBVs, S78 and TC3, were isolated. The IBVs were confirmed as IBV using sequencing. The IBV isolates were then used for one-direction neutralization tests with reference anti-IBV antisera."

    "Screening of all positive laboratory results for hMPV by both direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to identify patients between the ages of newborn to 19 years who were diagnosed at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, WA during the years 2006-2010. Of 368 total patients with positive hMPV laboratory results, we performed retrospective chart review to identify a subset of 55 patients with immunocompromised conditions. We defined an immunocompromised condition as presence of hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, rheumatologic disease receiving immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant, primary immunodeficiency, receipt of chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Using electronic chart review, we abstracted sociodemographic variables, symptoms, laboratory and radiologic values, clinical course, and treatment outcomes for these patients.",
    "Human metapneumovirus infections in our immunocompromised patient population was associated with high rates of LRTI at presentation, and an attributable mortality of 5%, rates substantially higher than that in the general population where hMPV is most commonly a self-limited URTI. In our study, 12 (23%) of immunocompromised children with hMPV were classified as having severe disease, and neutropenia was identified as a significant risk factor for disease severity. This rate is comparable or even higher than previous rates reported in seriously immunocompromised adult patients [13] .",
    "A prospective randomized study of ribavirin and IVIG administration, or of newer therapeutic agents under development for treatment of paramyxovirus infections [24, 25] , would be helpful given the high morbidity associated with hMPV in the immunocompromised population. In particular, a study of the use of novel agents, including fusion inhibitors [26] , could be studied in this population given their potential to serve as postexposure prophylaxis in high-risk individuals. The documentation of severe hMPV disease in immunocompromised children supports previous data documenting severe and fatal hMPV disease reported in adult HSCT recipients [9, 13] and highlights the need for treatment options in this population."

    "In six of the nine cases reported, the patients were Japanese. This may be due to racial differences in the risk of drug-induced lung injury and better recognition of the complication by clinicians in Japan because of better awareness. An additional contributory factor may be the difficulty in excluding viral syndrome with high accuracy by performing a viral panel test, because the test is not approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and is not commercially available in Japan. However, the involvement of these factors is purely theoretical, and the real reason is currently unclear.",

    "Infectious diseases are a major health concern worldwide, causing millions of illnesses and deaths each year. Newly emerging viral diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella and Escherichia coli outbreaks not only lead to wide-spread loss of life and health, but also result in heavy economic losses. To better navigate this landscape of infectious diseases, it is important to not only understand the mechanisms of individual diseases, but also the commonalities between them. Combining knowledge from related diseases will give us deeper insights into infection and host immune response, will enhance our ability to comprehend new diseases and lead to efficient development of therapeutics.",

    "A new human betacoronavirus in lineage c, tentatively called HCoV-EMC, was isolated from a patient from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who died from acute severe pneumonia and renal failure. The viral RNA has been detected in eight additional cases. Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the viral genomic RNA showed that it is a novel virus not previously detected in any other species and that its closest relatives are two Asian bat coronaviruses. HCoV-EMC may represent a sporadic spillover to humans from an unknown animal reservoir. In a recent article, van Boheemen et al. demonstrated how state-of-theart sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis can quickly provide critical insight into the viral genome sequence, phylogeny, replication strategy, and potential drug and vaccine targets and generate tools to evaluate the possible epidemic risk associated with this novel human virus.",
    "What can analysis of its RNA genome tell us about this new human coronavirus? Analysis of the HCoV-EMC genome was able to distinguish whether HCoV-EMC was a known human coronavirus with mutations that increased its virulence or a product of recombination between two or more known coronavirus species or, like SARS-CoV, a spillover of a zoonotic coronavirus that was transmitted, either directly or indirectly, to humans from an animal reservoir. The genomic analysis showed that HCoV-EMC is a new coronavirus that had never before been detected in any other species."

However, whether or not cats negative for the 3'-UTR gene were infected with FCoV was unknown. This status needs to be investigated further, such as by antibody test and quantitative RT-PCR.",
    "Ascites was obtained from a total of 854 privately owned domestic cats that were clinically suspected of having FIP from veterinary clinics throughout Japan in the period of June 2008 to October 2012. Viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). Detection of FCoV RNA was performed using a QIAGEN On-eStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) with the P205-P211 primer pair providing a 223 bp amplicon of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) gene of FCoV [10] , according to the manufacturer's instructions. FIPV strain 79-1146 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.) was used as a positive reference virus. Furthermore, for samples in which the 3'-UTR gene was detected, genotyping was performed with the nested RT-PCR reported by Addie et al. [4] , providing 360 and 218 bp amplicons of FCoV types I and II, respectively. FIPV strain UCD1 (kindly provided by Azabu University) and FIPV strain 79-1146 (same as above) were used as positive reference viruses for the types I and II, respectively. Gene positivity was analyzed by chi-square test (StatView, Adept Scientific, Herts, U.K.), and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
    "Then, the positivity was investigated in various purebreds. As shown in Table 1 , the positivities in the Norwegian forest cat (92.3%) and Scottish fold (77.6%) were significantly higher than the average for purebreds (62.2%) (P=0.0274, \u03c7 2 =4.9 and P=0.0251, \u03c7 2 =5.0, respectively), whereas that in the American shorthair (30.0%) was significantly lower than the average for purebreds (P<0.0001, \u03c7 2 =26.3); the positivity in the American shorthair was also lower than that in crossbreds, although the difference was not significant. The The breeds that consisted of fewer than 10 cats were classified together as others. A significance test (\u03c7 2 test) was performed between each breed and the average of purebreds (62.2%)."

    "The focus so far has been on those genes/cytokines that have, historically, been regarded as of particular interest and/or have been selected for interrogation. The advent of global transcriptome profiling has helped to identify genes whose function maybe less well understood. However, in time, some of these genes and their respective pathways could be particularly important in determining the susceptibility or resistance of chickens to diseases.

    "Overall, this review highlights some of the genes more consistently associated with relative resistance (or susceptibility) to some of the most important diseases and foodborne pathogens of commercial poultry and helps to inform/support appropriate immune-based strategies to optimize poultry health and productivity. The optimum immune response is balanced to effectively counteract the pathogen and minimize tissue damage and associated nutrient costs. However, it does seem that steering the immune system towards a more proinflammatory capability (in different compartments) provides better protection against pathogens and (thus) improved growth performance. Global gene expression profiling is providing a greater overview of genes and pathways involved in the bird's response to pathogen challenge and mechanisms of resistance. Further studies, particularly incorporating bird growth performance, are, however, necessary to better develop our understanding and application of informed outcomes.",
    "Coccidiosis is caused by species of the Eimeria parasite and is probably the most significant enteric disease affecting chickens. Eimeria are ubiquitous and can persist in the environment for long periods (Blake and Tomley, 2014) . There are seven species of Eimeria that are known to infect chickens, with Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima, and Eimeria tenella being the most prevalent and pathogenic for broilers (McDougald, 1998) . Each Eimeria species is recognized for targeting specific regions of the gut. E. acervulina affects the proximal small intestine, E. maxima affects the mid-intestine, and E. tenella affects the ceca (Hammond and Long, 1973) . Following ingestion of a sporulated Eimeria oocyst, mechanical disruption and digestive processes release four sporocysts and subsequently their sporozoites, which attach to, and invade, epithelial cells in the susceptible region of the intestine (Blake and Tomley, 2014) . The sporozoite then proceeds through further developmental phases (e.g., trophozoite, merozoite, gamete, zygote, etc.,) in the host before the formation of an unsporulated oocyst that is excreted into the environment, where it eventually sporulates. Invasion of epithelial cells causes damage to the epithelium and leads to haemorrhagic or malabsorptive disease, which results in poor growth performance or even death. Whilst good husbandry can play a part in managing coccidiosis, anticoccidial drugs and vaccination are necessary options for coccidiosis control, but each has their own drawbacks. Resistance to anticoccidial drugs has been a problem for many years, and vaccination costs can be prohibitive for the broiler industry (Blake and Tomley, 2014) ."

    "Ibaraki virus (IBAV) is one of the strains of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) serotype 2, a member of genus Orbivirus in Reoviridae family [11, 19] . It is known as a causative agent of Ibaraki disease characterized by the paralysis of swallowing muscles. Although the effective vaccine is widely used, the recent reemergence of Ibaraki disease in combination with the co-circulation with other EHDV raised the alert level for the epidemic of Ibaraki disease [13] . In addition, orbivirus family contains many viruses causing severe loss in the livestock industry. Therefore, it is important to understand the detailed molecular mechanism of their infection.",
    "Virus infection is initiated by the release of viral genome to the intracellular compartment of target cells. Several mechanisms are known for the genome release to cytoplasm, and one of the most well known mechanisms is the direct fusion mechanism utilized by several enveloped viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus-1, mouse hepatitis virus and Paramyxoviruses [5, 6] . Enveloped viruses are also known to use host endosomal pathway to facilitate their infection [12] ."

    "Background: Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on the cellular machinery of the host to regenerate and manufacture their proteins. Most antiviral drugs on the market today target viral proteins. However, the more recent strategies involve targeting the host cell proteins or pathways that mediate viral replication. This new approach would be effective for most viruses while minimizing drug resistance and toxicity. Methods: Cytomegalovirus replication, latency, and immune response are mediated by the intermediate early protein 2, the main protein that determines the effectiveness of drugs in cytomegalovirus inhibition. This review explains how intermediate early protein 2 can modify the action of cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive, and antiviral drug. It also links all the pathways mediated by cyclosporin A, cytomegalovirus replication, and its encoded proteins. Results: Intermediate early protein 2 can influence the cellular cyclophilin A pathway, affecting cyclosporin A as a mediator of viral replication or anti-cytomegalovirus drug. Conclusion: Cyclosporin A has a dual function in cytomegalovirus pathogenesis. It has the immunosuppressive effect that establishes virus replication through the inhibition of T-cell function. It also has an anti-cytomegalovirus effect mediated by intermediate early protein 2. Both of these functions involve cyclophilin A pathway.",
    "There are several CsA derivatives ( Figure 2 ) that interact well with viruses and do not cause serious side effects. [194] [195] [196] Among these derivatives, alisporivir (Debio-025) (Figure 2(a) ), a non-immunosuppressive analog of CsA, was synthesized to contain sarcosine instead of d-methylalanine at position 3 of the PPIase domain and methyl-leucine instead of ethylvaline at position 4 of the calcineurin domain. These modifications have altered the PPIase activity and calcineurinbinding ability of the derivatives. 197 However, alisporivir still results in side effects including reversible hyperbilirubinemia and pancreatitis when used in combination with PEG-IFNa2a and ribavirin to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. 198 NIM811 ( Figure  2 (b)), another nonimmunosuppressive analog of CsA, is similar in structure to the parent molecule with one modification: methyl-leucine at position 4 being replaced by methyl-isoleucine. This derivative has antiviral effects 195 while exhibiting the same pharmacokinetic profile as CsA without nephrotoxicity. 196, 199 In 2010, SCY-635 ( Figure 2 (c)) was synthesized. 200 This CsA derivative inhibits HCV infection 201 without detectable inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase. Treatment with this drug is associated with transient increases in interferon a, k1, and k3, the cytokines responsible for the clearance of the viruses. 202 Another derivation of CsA, EDP-546, is metabolically stable with favorable pharmacokinetics that allows for less frequent and low therapeutic dosing of the drug. It is also an effective bilirubin transporter without affecting CYP450, a major protein in drug metabolism. 203, 204 Sanglifehrin A (SFA) (Figure 3 ) is a new immunosuppressive agent 205 isolated from the Streptomyces strain A92-308110. This protein interacts strongly with CyPA 206-208 but not with calcineurin phosphatase. 209 It is also a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition and heart reperfusion injury. 210."

    "In some TCRs, the two different orientations (a-P2A-b and b-P2A-a) resulted in nearly equal expression. This similarity between orientations was primarily observed in TCRs with the highest TCR V beta expression (.25% of CD8 T cells). These TCRs may be particularly stable and thus expression is not influenced so significantly by endogenous TCRs. The end result is that a majority of the TCR cassettes have an optimal orientation and testing both can be an easy solution that significantly increases expression.",

    "Respiratory virus infections in children are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Methods: A total of 897 clinical specimens were collected from February 2007 to January 2008 and transported to the National Influenza Center. Two hundred and two samples belonged to children under the age of six from 897 specimens, described above, were selected. Then they were tested for influenza virus types and subtypes by real time PCR assay subsequently, the specimens were tested for RSV and hMPV by hemi-nested multiplex PCR and parainfluenza viruses type 1-4 by hemi-nested multiplex PCR and adenovirus by hemi-nested PCR. Results: The throat swab was taken from the Kawasaki case with the history of chicken`s contact. The specimen was tested for all influenza subtypes especially H5N1 and the results were negative. Meanwhile PCR was done for screening of other respiratory viruses that results came out positive for RSV and hMPV. Conclusion: In the present study, we demonstrated the possibility to detect dual infection caused by RSV and hMPV, but because of the extravagant pattern of this case, more investigation is suggested specially on Kawasaki patients.",
    "In the present study, we demonstrated the possibility to detect dual infection which caused by RSV and hMPV. Due to the lack of sensitivity of conventional methods detection of co-infections with different respiratory viruses had been un-derestimated (13) . Severe RSV bronchiolitis in small patient series had been recognized because of co-infection with other viral pathogens (14) . Some previous studies have lighted up increased clinical severity in case of dual infection caused by RSV and hMPV (8, 9) . Greensill et al. observed a 70% co-infection rate with HMPV and RSV and a 90% co-infection rate among intubated infants with hMPV and RSV admitted to their PICU (8) . Although Greensill et al. did not include an appropriate control group in their study, these findings suggest that co-infection with both hMPV and RSV is common and that together the two viruses may contribute to increase the severity of disease (9, 14) . Whereas in other reports hMPV did not contribute to the severity of RSV infection (15, 16) . The basis of the pathogenesis of severe RSV disease is multifactorial. Since severe RSV disease may develop in apparently healthy children, known host risk factors cannot completely account for instances of severe illness. Preexisting or maternally acquired immunity, innate immunity, viral factors and genotypes and environment all likely contribute to disease pathogenesis. We detected co-infection of hMPV and RSV in Kawasaki patient without special respiratory sign and symptoms, we could not find the patient to follow up her and study more about the immunity status and other possibilities of this scenario. More investigation is suggested specially on Kawasaki patients to detect the viral pathogens."

    "Whole-genome sequencing is probably the most accurate and reliable method to identify and type strains of a species. SNPs and other polymorphisms that serve as informative genetic characters are globally determined and therefore enable a more complete evaluation of inferred evolutionary relationships. The cumulative differences between two or more sequences provide a larger framework upon which reliable phylogenies may be established. Strain genotypes that are built upon SNP variation are highly amenable to evolutionary reconstruction and can be readily analyzed in a phylogenetic and a population genetic context to: (i) assign unknown strains into well-characterized clusters, (ii) reveal closely related siblings of a particular strain and (iii) examine the prevalence of a specific allele in a population of closely related strains that may in turn correlate with phenotypic features of the infectious agent (1) . More directly and for a variety of purposes such as forensic investigations or epidemiological investigations, SNPs provide potential markers for the purpose of strain identification.",
    "Detection, identification and typing of infectious microorganisms are crucial in many areas of basic and translational research. There is an urgent need for accurate, high-resolution microbial genotyping methods, in spite of the existence of a number of widely used typing methods. That is because the current methods offer only low-resolution and limited genotyping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), horizontal gene transfer and/or intragenic recombination are all known to lead to variations and genome plasticity in an organism. The diversity of an organism can be explicitly understood provided these events are identified and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively at the whole-genome level."

    "We have used the sedimentation behavior of catalase and thyroglobulin in parallel gradients as markers to get an estimate of the size of M/S complexes.

    "When the m A b a M was used instead, coprecipitation of labeled S was not observed immediately, but only after 10-20 min of chase. Later, the amount of coprecipitated S, including its cleaved form S/gp90, gradually increased. These observations indicate that S associated with M before its processing to the mature forms S/gpl80 and S/gp90. M and S thus engage in complex formation at different rates: M rapidly associates with S, while S does so only after a considerable lag time. This implies that newly synthesized M molecules associate with S molecules already present.",
    "Under conditions of analysis, the stability of the envelope glycoprotein complexes is critically dependent on the detergents used for their solubilization. M-S interactions are preserved in a combination of NP-40 and sodium deoxycholate. Several observations indicated that M/S complexes do not form nonspecifically after solubilization. First, other proteins were not significantly coprecipitated with M and S. Second, newly synthesized S started to associate with M only after a lag time of about 20 min. Third, M/S complexes were not formed upon mixing lysates containing M and S that had been separately expressed. Moreover, flotation analysis ruled out the possibility that M and S were coisolated as part of detergent-insoluble membranes (data not shown). Collectively, these data provide evidence for the existence and specificity of M-S interactions.",
    "If these interpretations were correct, the M and S proteins would be incorporated into virus particles with different kinetics. We therefore performed a pulse-chase labeling of infected cells and monitored the appearance of labeled proteins in extracellular virus. Because MHV is assembled intracellularly, such an analysis provides an indirect measurement of the kinetics of incorporation of newly synthesized proteins into virus particles. Virus was purified by pelleting and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A) . The results of the quantifications of the radioactivities in the bands representing M and S (S/gp180 + S/gp90) are shown in Fig. 3 B."

    "Despite all this good news, much remains to be done. It was recently estimated that there are 320,000 mammalian viruses (2), many of which may have the potential for human transmission. Even if only a small fraction of these viruses can jump into humans and cause disease, humanity is living under a tremendous threat from viral zoonoses. Less expensive drugs are needed for treating those with viral infections such as hepatitis C. While the HPV vaccine can prevent many infections, there are viral types that are not covered by the vaccine, and many millions of people were infected before the vaccine came on the market. Infections with numerous other viruses are not treatable due to the lack of effective antivirals. Clearly, vaccines against HIV, hepatitis C, and Ebola, to name a few, would save countless lives. New pathogens continue to emerge, and existing nonviral pathogens become resistant to common antibiotics. Hence, we are living at a time of great need for the discipline of virology.",
    "We think that the field of virology and, by extension, the field of microbiology are at a critical crossroads. Funding for research in the United States and elsewhere is stagnant, if not losing pace with inflation. Working with the most pathogenic organisms requires even higher costs and is heavily regulated. Some senior scientists are rethinking their career choices, and there is growing concern that young scientists will be discouraged from entering the field, especially in areas of controversial research, such as studies of the transmissibility of highly pathogenic influenza viruses (3). While some have argued that virology is a dying field, that assertion has been elegantly refuted by Dan DiMaio (4). Adding to these stresses, scientists and society are struggling with a new antiintellectual movement that challenges scientific conclusions, from anthropomorphically induced climate change to the absence of any link between vaccines and autism. The rise of antivaccine movements is of particular concern to society, for reduced vaccination rates threaten to undermine some of the greatest accomplishments of virology and public health in the 20th century. The combination of reduced funding, increased regulation, experimental controversies, and the emerging antiscience intellectual milieu is a toxic blend that makes this time one of great jeopardy for virology."

    "\u2022 We also outline the current knowledge of existing IAV proteins and the role of alternative splicing and frameshift in their formation. The potential functions of these proteins, if known, are also discussed.",
    "The IAVs are among the fastest evolving families of viruses [6] and are notable for their ability to rapidly change from one season to the next or even within seasons [7] . Over the course of a few generations, the virus can change sufficiently to become virulent. Like many emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [8] , IAV depends on animal reservoirs, where they can reside [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and transfer between species that share the same environment [14] . As one major reservoir involves migratory birds [15] , the potential to rapidly spread an infection throughout the world is of major concern and IAV is under constant watch (http://www.who.int/ csr/don/archive/year/en/). During the past 100 years, there have been three major epidemics with extensive fatalities [16] and one minor one (mostly because of quick action from the WHO and health practitioners) [17, 18] , the Spanish flu (1918, H1N1, 75 million fatalities worldwide), the Asian flu (1957, H2N2, 2 million fatalities), the Hong Kong flu (1968, H3N2, 1 million fatalities) and more recently the swine flu (2009, H1N1, 14 000 fatalities).",

These factors make it difficult to understand and control PEDV infections. Therefore, future work should continue to trace the variability of PEDV strains and co-infections of other enteric viruses, improve PEDV vaccines using variant strains as candidates and elucidate the pathogenicity of PEDV variant strains.",
    "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. PEDV infections can occur in pigs of all ages, and infections are most serious in piglets, with morbidity and mortality often reaching 100% [9, 40] . Pigs that tolerate PEDV infections usually exhibit growth retardation, reduced food conversion rates, increased feeding costs and the co-occurrence of other diseases. Furthermore, PEDV infections result in reduced pig slaughter rates, insufficient pork supplies and pork price instability, because of a large number of piglet deaths.",
    "Recently, a large number of studies of PEDV have provided an in-depth understanding of PEDV infections in the pig population in China. In particular, a trivalent live vaccine for viral diarrheal diseases of swine has been authorized for (b) Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (1,000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the recombinant region of each potential recombinant event; (c) Fast neighbor-joining (NJ) tree (1,000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the non-recombinant region of each potential recombinant event.",
    "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); manifestations of the disease are diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Starting from the end of 2010, a PED outbreak occurred in several pig-producing provinces in southern China. Subsequently, the disease spread throughout the country and caused enormous economic losses to the pork industry. Accumulating studies demonstrated that new PEDV variants that appeared in China were responsible for the PED outbreak. In the current mini-review, we summarize PEDV epidemiology and vaccination in China.",
    "Genetically engineered vaccines: Mucosal immunity plays an important role in the immune mechanism of viral diarrheal diseases. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies secreted by the intestinal mucosa can defend against invading pathogens. Oral vaccines can stimulate mucosal immunity and produce protective mucosal and serum IgA antibodies, and they are an effective method for prevention of intestinal infectious diseases. For PEDV oral vaccines, Hou et al. reported that lactic acid bacteria expressing the PEDV N protein could activate the production of mucosal IgA and circulating IgG antibodies against the PEDV N protein [16] . Ge et al. reported that recombinant lactobacilli expressing * Group was defined based on the phylogenetic tree of S1 gene of the selected PEDV strains in our study (see Fig. 2 )."

    "Moreover, ICP0 interacts with the host cyclin D3 (Kawaguchi et al., 1997) . However, it was recently reported that stress, rather than the cell cycle per se, may be a critical feature (Bringhurst and Schaffer, 2006) . Clearly, the interaction of herpesviruses with the cell proliferation apparatus is complex and likely involves several host and viral proteins. Identifying novel players that might be incorporated into mature virions may thus be very useful to clarify this process.",
    "Interestingly, HSV-1 does not require cells to be in the S-phase and even arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S transition step (Shadan et al., 1994; Song et al., 2000) , which partly explains why it can grow in non-dividing neurons. While the precise mechanism of this arrest is unclear, it is known that the viral ICP0 protein and the VP16 cellular partner HCF modulate the cell cycle (Hobbs and DeLuca, 1999; Lomonte and Everett, 1999; Piluso et al., 2002) .",
    "An interesting scenario is the possible regulation of apoptosis by host proteins loaded onto viral particles. Apoptosis is regulated both negatively and positively by several viruses (Teodoro and Branton, 1997; Goodkin et al., 2004) , presumably to insure their survival at the early stages of the infection but their efficient release later on. Conceptually, the presence of anti-apoptotic proteins in herpes particles might thus provide a mean to quickly evade death upon entry, while the presence of pro-apoptotic proteins on newly assembled/enveloped viral particles may trigger or stimulate their extracellular release. Only further work will resolve this open question."

    "Infectious diseases have caused great catastrophes in human history, as in the example of the plague, which wiped out half of the population in Europe in the 14th century. Ebola virus and H7N9 avian influenza virus are 2 lethal pathogens that we have encountered in the second decade of the 21st century. Ebola infection is currently being seen in West Africa, and H7N9 avian flu appears to have settled in Southeast Asia. This article focuses on the current situation and the future prospects of these potential infectious threats to mankind.",
    "Three (H7N9, H6N1, and H10N8) avian influenza viruses broke the animal-human barrier in Asia in 2013. 31 One avian influenza case was detected in Taiwan due to H6N1 subtype, whereas 2 of 3 H10N8 human infections observed in China were lethal. 31 However, human infections due to H7N9 have been progressively increasing since its first identification in 2013, and approximately one-third of the H7N9-infected patients died. 31-33 Avian flu had the potential to spread \"silently\" among poultry and H7N9 infections did not cause severe disease in poultry, accordingly. 34 Viral characteristics. Influenza is an infection of birds and mammals caused by RNA viruses from the family of Orthomyxoviridae. There are 2 main types of influenza virus, type A and type B. Type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the other influenza types and cause the most severe disease. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N) localized on the virus surface. So far, 18 hemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes were documented. 35 Influenza B almost exclusively infects humans and is less common than influenza A. 36",
    "O utbreak is an epidemiological definition to describe an unexpected occurrence of an infection at a certain time and place. It may affect a small and a localized group, or impact on millions of people across continents. Two cases of a linked rare infection can be defined as an outbreak. A revisit through the history discloses that outbreaks were vast, deadly, and basically changed the course of human history. 1 As an example, the plague reshaped the landscape of Europe and the world between 1347 and 1351. During this period, the global population was estimated to be 450 million, and 75 million at a minimum are believed to have perished. Consequently, half of Europe died in a period of 4 years. 2 In the pre-antibiotic era, bacterial outbreaks caused much more mass destruction compared with other outbreaks with different infectious agents. 1 But, this trend changed with the advent of antibiotics and viral outbreaks emerged. We believed that Ebola virus and H7N9 avian influenza virus are the most potential pathogens to cause mass destruction in the world. Thus, in this paper, we will focus on the current outbreaks of these 2 viral infections with the potential to cause mass destruction, and to greatly impact the international travelers."

    "A randomized controlled trial might also be undertaken, although with 1:1 randomization, a statistically significant reduction in mortality from 50% to 25% would require 210 patients, and only half would receive active treatment. Given the known high mortality rate of untreated patients, investigators might instead choose an adaptive trial design. This would minimize the number of untreated placebo subjects and allow different treatment regimens to be tested simultaneously for efficacy and safety.",
    "It must be emphasized that treating the host response would not prevent or cure Ebola virus infection itself, but it might allow individual patients to survive long enough to develop an immune response that eliminates the virus. These agents could be used in combination with antivirals if they are available.",
    "Unfortunately, supervising physicians and health officials in Sierra Leone have not released reports of the treatment results, although they exchanged letters and memoranda describing their experience, with one letter noting \"remarkable improvement\" on treatment (O.M.R., unpublished observation). It will be up to others to rigorously review and validate these findings. (22) . Perhaps atorvastatin and irbesartan treatment of some of these patients helps explain the decrease in the Ebola case fatality rate observed at the Hastings Center."

    "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the direct effects of a PED outbreak on the subsequent numbers of pigs marketed. We are continuously recording the production parameters of these herds with our data-recording system PigINFO and plan to investigate the potential risk factors for PED outbreaks. Sporadic PED continues to occur in 2015, and the strict biosecurity measures against PED must be strengthened because PED outbreaks cause serious economic losses.",
    "Although many case reports have described PED outbreaks and compared PED viruses genetically, very little information is available regarding the effects of PED outbreaks on swine productivity and economic factors. The objective of this study was to summarize the characteristics of the PED infections in the second epidemic in Japan using data from herds belonging to the clients of consulting veterinarians. We also investigated the effects of the herd-level PED status on productivity using a data recording system (PigINFO) recently developed for Japanese swine producers [17] .",
    "In Japan, PED was first confirmed at one swine farm in 1982 [14] . In 1996, a large PED epidemic occurred in 102 affected herds, and 39,539 pigs died [10] . From 1997 to 2006, only sporadic cases of PED were reported (1-3 cases/ year), and no cases were reported from 2007 to 2012 [10] . On 1 October 2013, a new case of PED was reported in a herd located in Okinawa Prefecture. From December 2013 to February 2014, the first PED epidemic (0-25 cases/week) was reported, primarily involving herds located on the southern island of Japan. From March to June 2014, a more severe PED epidemic (5-100 cases/week) was reported among herds throughout Japan [10] . By the end of August, these two PED epidemics had affected 817 herds, detected in 38 prefectures [9] and caused serious economic damage to the swine industry, as in the United States."

The Dipstick 'Eiken' Rota (Dipstick) showed the highest sensitivity out of the seven RAD kits against all selected strains in limited dilution analyses, which was consistent with the results for equine rotavirus previously reported. RT-PCR had 10 0 -10 3 -fold higher sensitivity than the Dipstick. NGS using thirteen RT-PCR-negative fecal samples revealed that all samples yielded RVA reads and especially that two of them covered all 11 genome segments. Moreover, mapping reads to reference sequences allowed genotyping. The NGS would be sensitive and useful for analysis of less dependent on specific primers and screening of genotypes."

    "We performed a retrospective review of all adult asthmatics requiring mechanical ventilatior and/or ECMO for near-fatal asthma admitted to our single large tertiary hospital between 2011 and 2016. Clinical and demographic data including ventilator parameters, biochemical and immunological indices, and microbiology isolates were recorded. We compared patients requiring ECMO with patients requiring conventional mechanical ventilation only, to identify any factors that were significantly associated with the need for ECMO.",
    "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has developed as a critical tool permitting lung protection in severe respiratory failure. Its use was largely confined to acute respiratory distress syndrome [1]; however, as technology has advanced, it is now used in a range of respiratory diseases, including asthma. In the context of near-fatal asthma exacerbations, ECMO provides a management strategy for difficult-to-ventilate patients who would otherwise be unlikely to survive. Importantly, in asthma, traditional mechanical ventilation strategies can be associated with volutrauma and barotrauma due to the high pressures required in the presence of severe bronchospasm [2] . To date, there is a paucity of data for ECMO use in acute asthma and it is unknown whether specific clinical or inflammatory characteristics are associated with the need for ECMO."

    "Labeling with charged topographical markers and affinity studies revealed that S-layers from several Bacillus strains do not possess a net negative charge as demonstrated for the underlying peptidoglycan-containing layer or other bacterial surface structures (S ara & Sleytr, 1987a; Gruber & Sleytr, 1991; S ara et al., 1992) . In native S-layers, carboxyl groups are neutralized by an equal number of amino groups, leading to a charge neutral outer surface (Weigert & S ara, 1995) .",
    "To summarize, S-layer carrier conjugates are superior vaccine carriers because (1) they elicit DTH and immuno-protective antibody responses without the use of extraneous adjuvants, (2) they can be administered by several different immunization routes (intramuscular, subcutaneous, nasal/oral), and they are immunological unique, which means that antibody and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to each S-layer are specific and not cross-reactive (Malcolm et al., 1993b) .",
    "[The copyright line for this article was changed on 7 October 2014 after original online publication]",

    "Self-assembly products are formed in solution during the dialysis of the disrupting agent against selected buffer solutions (ionic strength and pH). Monitoring the time course of self-assembly by light scattering yielded multiphasic kinetics with a rapid initial phase and slow consecutive processes of higher than second order (Jaenicke et al., 1985) . The rapid phase may be attributed to the formation of oligomeric precursors. Concentrationdependent light scattering measurements gave evidence for a 'critical concentration' of association, suggesting that patches of 12-16 proteins are formed and recrystallize into the final (native) S-layer structure.",
    "In a recently carried out detailed study using in situ AFM, it was shown that the reassembly of SbpA S-layer proteins from Lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM2177 on mica does not necessarily follow the classical pathway of crystal growth. Instead, a kinetic trap keeping the system at a higher-energy, long-lived transient state may hinder the reassembly into extended matrices . Over time, finally the trapped state transforms into a stable, low energy state. Careful analysis of the time and temperature dependence of formation and transformation yielded an energy difference by only 1.6 kJ mol \u00c01 (or 0.7 kT). But the energy barrier to transform into the final low energy state is 38 times higher (61 kJ mol \u00c01 )."

    "To facilitate efficient infections, viruses have evolved a wide range of evasion strategies, targeting host DNA sensors, adaptor proteins and transcription factors. In this review, the current literature on virus-induced activation of the STING pathway is presented and we discuss recently identified viral evasion mechanisms targeting different steps in this antiviral pathway.",
    "Cellular sensing of virus-derived nucleic acids is essential for early defenses against virus infections. In recent years, the discovery of DNA sensing proteins, including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and gamma-interferoninducible protein (IFI16), has led to understanding of how cells evoke strong innate immune responses against incoming pathogens carrying DNA genomes. The signaling stimulated by DNA sensors depends on the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), to enable expression of antiviral proteins, including type I interferon.",
    "With the accumulating insight into the mechanisms of viral evasion of DNA sensing, there is now a need to understand the importance of these mechanisms in vivo. Further knowledge on the cellular targets and mechanisms of action of viral strategies to evade the DNA sensing machinery will lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of viral diseases, and could also uncover potential targets for future immunomodulatory drugs."

    "All experiments were approved by the Committees on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Kitasato University and the University of Tokyo. For immunohistochemistry, 48 samples of canine mammary gland tissue embedded in paraffin blocks were obtained from the histopathological files in the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory, Kitasato University. Although the classification method about simple carcinoma is under controversy [18] , the diagnosis of all specimens was based on the WHO classification [11] . Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human SSTR2 (1:300 dilution, bs-1138R, Bioss, Boston, MA, U.S.A.). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (R), Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) was used as the secondary antibody. After immunoreaction, sections were colorized with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Canine pancreas tissues were used as positive controls. Negative controls were carried out by replacing the primary antibodies with antibody diluents.",
    "Somatostatin (SST) is a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus, pancreas and intestine; it regulates both endocrine and exocrine gland function [17] , and downregulates cell proliferation in various tissues of many species including dogs [1, 3, 4, 10, 14] . Among the SST receptor (SSTR) superfamily, SSTR2 is the most dominant receptor, with the highest affinity to the ligand and the strongest antiproliferative effect [3] . In human breast cancer, tumor tissues that express SSTRs are less aggressive and more differentiated than tumors with little SSTRs expression, which are massive and highly malignant [5] . These findings lead to the speculation that SSTR signal transduction is closely related to the malignancy of human breast cancer.",
    "In dogs, all subtypes of SSTRs, except SSTR4, have been already identified, and their expression was confirmed in just several tissues, such as pituitary and pancreas [2, 16] . Although SSTRs are predicted to be a molecular target of breast cancer therapy, there is little information about SSTRs in dogs. Hence, in this study, we examined and compared the distribution and expression of SSTR2 in normal canine mammary tissues, benign mammary gland tumor (MGT) and malignant MGT. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting methods were utilized."

    "The discussion of H5N1 influenza virus gain-of-function research has focused chiefly on its risk-to-benefit ratio. Another key component of risk is the level of containment employed. Work is more expensive and less efficient when pursued at biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) than at BSL-3 or at BSL-3 as modified for work with agricultural pathogens (BSL-3-Ag). However, here too a risk-to-benefit ratio analysis is applicable. BSL-4 procedures mandate daily inspection of facilities and equipment, monitoring of personnel for signs and symptoms of disease, and logs of dates and times that personnel, equipment, supplies, and samples enter and exit containment. These measures are not required at BSL-3 or BSL-3-Ag. Given the implications of inadvertent or deliberate release of high-threat pathogens with pandemic potential, it is imperative that the World Health Organization establish strict criteria for biocontainment that can be fairly applied in the developing world, as well as in more economically developed countries.",
    "In lieu of a shift to BSL-4, it may be feasible to introduce specific requirements for research at BSL-3-Ag for agents with pandemic potential, particularly research concerned with a gain of function that enhances virulence or transmissibility. Such requirements could be developed by the World Health Organization as an extension of the International Health Regulations circular Laboratory Biorisk Management: Strategic Framework for Management 2012-2016 (6) . Given the implications for humankind, whatever course we pursue must be developed with global consultation and oversight."

    "Biosensing is an important activity due to myriads of cell signaling pathways and circuits in cells. It is an important component of two-way communication between implanted engineered cells and natural cells of the body. Examples of synthetic biosensing are [9] : (1) Transcriptional biosensors are built by linking environment-responsive promoters to engineered gene circuits for programmed transcription. (2) Translational biosensors are typically built by linking RNA aptamer domains to RNA regulatory domains. (3) Posttranslational biosensors consist of membrane-bound protein receptors that trigger signal transduction cascades.",
    "In conventional one-way biosensing, a therapeutic substance is released from an implanted device or a genetically engineered cell in response to a programmed mechanism, e.g. release of insulin according to rise of blood glucose level. A two-way communication between the host, enabled by construction of synthetic circuits, can enable more personalized control of adjustment of therapy from implanted cells.",
    "The ability to control expression in target areas within a genome is important for synthetic biologists who are developing chemical-producing organisms for commercial applications. In Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) Effector Technology, two hypervariable amino acid residues in each repeat recognize 1 bp in the target DNA [10] . Recognition sequences of TAL effectors are predictable. The TAL code is similar to a navigation system for the genome, allowing pinpoint delivery of functional control elements to any specified sequence. The modular protein architecture has enabled the construction of artificial effectors with new specificities. ",
    "To apply this method to other types of cells, researchers will have to design and synthesize the DNA of choice and develop a system to boot up the genome. These two tasks will have to be accomplished in parallel for every new species. Accuracy in the genetic code is important for engineering of synthetic genes. The J. Craig Venter Institute is currently working on a project with the National Institutes of Health of the USA and Novartis on vaccine production using this technology."

    "Frequency of tuberculosis among diabetic patients in the PRC infection and an increased prevalence of latent TB infection. Therefore, improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB are needed. In addition, the incidence of TB is increasing with the increase in DM, chronic diseases such as AIDS, and increased drug resistance. Although over the last 20 years the People's Republic of China has successfully reduced its TB burden with its excellent free China National Tuberculosis Program (incorporating the \"DOTS\" [directly observed treatment + short-course chemotherapy] model for TB control), the disease is still a considerable problem. 22",
    "We conducted another investigation of DM and TB from January 2003 to December 2012 in our DM clinic at the Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China (Table 3) , which identified 15,302 ward patients with DM and 758 (4.95%) ward patients with DM + TB in the past 10 years. The number of ward patients with DM increased yearly and the number of ward patients with DM + TB also increased yearly. Our data are in line with a previous report. 20 We also strictly ruled out other risk factors for TB including HIV, steroid use, and immunocompromised states that may coexist in patients with DM and TB. ",
    "The frequency of TB among patients with DM in the People's Republic of China is about 958 per 100,000 people, which is much higher than that of the general population (78 per 100,000), as reported by the WHO in 2011. 18 Active TB screening in patients with DM may increase earlier detection, facilitating better treatment of TB. It also may improve clinical outcomes with anti-TB treatment and DM routine care. Moreover, early diagnosis of TB in DM patients will reduce the risk of TB transmission. The introduction of active TB screening in DM patients may lead to better use of the well-established DOTS system to monitor, record, and report information about TB patients. Bidirectional screening for DM and TB should be of significant benefit in the People's Republic of China."

While this can identify new classes of PRF signals, it is based on the assumption that PRF outcomes should mimic those observed in viral genomes and thus cannot identify new operational outcomes of frameshifting."

    "Periostin is a member of the matricellular family of proteins that are highly expressed at the site of injury or inflammation. Periostin can potentially interact with other extracellular matrix proteins in asthma to mediate airway remodeling in particular fibrosis. Th2 cytokines, such as IL-13, are potent inducers of periostin, and periostin has thus been utilized as a Th2 biomarker. Periostin has the potential to mediate peribronchial fibrosis as it activates TGF-\u03b21, 51 up-regulates type I collagen, 51 induces differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, 52 and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Overexpressed periostin in epithelial cells upregulates collagen fibrils."

To identify siRNAs, using the software Bowtie v.0.12.7 with 0 mismatch, we aligned all the cleaned reads to the viral genome sequences and calculated the average depths and the genome coverages. The average depth is calculated as the total number of nucleotides of the aligned reads divided by the read-covered positions on the reference genome. The genome coverage represents the proportion of read-covered positions against the genome length. Reads obtained above were analyzed using Excel. Single-base resolution maps along with virus genomes were created using Bowtie tools and in-house Perl scripts. sRNAs from each sample were assembled de novo using Velvet. Assembled contigs were used to search the Gen-Bank/EMBL/DDBJ database using BLASTn or BLASTx. Coverage and distribution of virus-specific contigs by siRNAs were determined using the program MAQ under default parameters, and results were exported to Microsoft Excel for further analysis. Primers were designed for amplification and Sanger sequencing based on the identified viral contigs using Vector NTI (Invitrogen). Phylogenetic tree analysis was performed using MEGA 5.0.",
    "In this study, we analyzed the characterizations of the siRNAs in CymMV-and ORSV-coinfected P. equestris plants, and explored their potential roles in targeting a series of P. equestris genes which are related to host stress response, RNAi antiviral immunity defense, cytoskeleton, metabolic processes (chloroplast photosynthesis and mitochondria energy supply pathways, fatty acid biosynthetic process and protein phosphorylation), pathogenesis and symptomology. We also found that siRNAs derived from CymMV and ORSV could decrease the expression levels of all target genes in P. equestris. All results in this study provide an understanding of the RNAi mechanism and an insight into the function and implication of RNAi pathway in viruses-P. equestris interactions."

    "MyD88 signaling was largely repressed by the use of statins in MERS patients, this could lead to exacerbated compensatory signaling by other innate immune factors, resulting in a poor disease outcome in coronavirus patients. Of critical importance is that the absence of these central TLR adaptor molecules results in increased viral loads that persist for longer periods of time than in wild-type mice following SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection (7, 13, 14) . Currently, high viral titers during the acute phase of infection are thought to be a potential factor that increases the likelihood of person-to-person transmission of highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Caution must be used when weighing potential therapeutic options that may increase the likelihood of the spread of these viruses."

We analyzed the measured values before and after the treatment in each group by using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and considered only p-values less than 0.05 to be statistically significant."

    "The Gini coefficients of these four conditions are presented in Table 1 . In the first two conditions (C1 and C2, without temporal variability), the Gini coefficients were both very close to zero, indicating all individuals had almost equal contribution to the new infection, despite C1 having no degree order change and higher prevalence. In the latter two conditions (C3 and C4, with temporal variability), C3 had a larger Gini coefficient, indicating the individuals with constantly high degree order contributed to more new infections than the lower order ones.",
    "In our simulation of disease dynamics, we assume that the disease does not substantially change the individual's behavior. This implicit assumption is appropriate for non-clinical conditions and for demonstrating the importance of dynamic networks on disease dynamics. Nevertheless, in realistic systems modeling clinical diseases, animals may change their behavior during the infected stage, resulting in a different contact pattern [37] [38] [39] [40] . Furthermore we have assumed frequency-dependent transmission through contact to simplify the model. To model more realistic directly transmitted disease systems and design effective controlling strategies, it is important to make the correct assumptions about transmission mode (frequencydependent or density-dependent, or a combination of both), observe the actual contact network for all the individuals over time, and understand both temporal and individual heterogeneity in the contact network [41] [42] [43] .",
    "The time series of hourly number of contacts is shown in Fig. 1 for all three pens. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried to investigate temporal and individual variability. ANOVA results revealed highly significant hourly variability nested in day (P 5 0.003), individual variability nested in pen (P 5 0.001), and at pen level (P 5 0.003) but marginal insignificance between day variability (P 5 0.06). Further spectrum analysis confirmed a peak frequency correlated to an approximate 6.25-h period in number of contacts. Thus there was a clear pattern of diurnal cycle in network degree distribution.",
    "An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to further test whether the degree distribution of the networks varied among different individuals in different pens and/or in different hours on different days. The hour factor was nested in the day and the individuals were nested in the pen. Furthermore, spectrum analysis was performed with timeSeries package in R to explore the periodic (within-day) change of the time series of aggregated degrees (number of total contacts of all calves in each pen) in the networks."

    "The best laboratories maintain careful training and testing of operators, tracking and testing of pathogen samples, and rigorous safety protocols. Notwithstanding these efforts, lapses of protocol occur, as recently documented at the CDC high-containment laboratory (http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-06 -13/cdc-bioterror-lab/55557704/1). Infections of laboratory workers occur, as most recently emphasized by the tragic death of a technician working on Neisseria meningitidis B in a BSL-2 laboratory in San Francisco, CA (6) , and other events before that. Standards of laboratory safety vary by institution (given the strong reliance on institutions and even individual investigators to enforce the details of biosafety between government inspections) and by country, with tremendous heterogeneity in the precautions required for working on a particular pathogen (7).",
    "Recommended measures. While the current moratorium is operative, we have an opportunity to define a set of conditions that will minimize the risks of laboratory-released infections or epidemics. Clearly we must continue to emphasize the importance of learning about the pathogenesis of high-risk infectious agents and recognize the likelihood that the greatest infectious risks come from nature, like H5N1 influenza. Hence, there is a continuing need for research on a wide variety of pathogens, including those that are not currently fashionable; we note that study of coronaviruses would never have been considered \"pandemic preparedness\" before SARS, but it was. Only a very limited number of experiments need to be done with potential pandemic pathogens themselves. We urge consideration of the following policies.",
    "While these figures may sound low, the key problem is that they increase as more laboratories undertake work on PPPs and as they do so over a longer period. Even at the NIAID, the intramural estimated rate of 2 exposures per 100,000 operator-hours, a remarkably low rate that likely reflects very careful practices, one would expect 1 out of every 50 technicians working half-time (1,000 h) in such a laboratory to be exposed each year and 1 of every 600 to become infected. Over a 10-year period, with 100 such laboratories each employing 5 such technicians, one would expect 100 exposures and about 8 infections. Klotz and Sylvester estimate that with 42 laboratories working on PPP and a 0.3% risk of an escape per laboratory-year, there is an 80% risk of an escape of a PPP every 13 years (5) .",
    "With the proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories across the globe, including many set up for surveillance and response to a natural influenza pandemic, decisions by the United States and other biomedical research leaders about research on mammaliantransmissible H5N1 viruses will have rapid consequences for the scale of research around the globe. If the wealthy countries adopt a policy that any experiment with these viruses is acceptable as long as it is done in a containment facility, a similar ethic will likely prevail globally, but the quality of containment will vary. If, on the other hand, they acknowledge the unique risks posed by potential pandemic pathogens and help to generate a process that has international support, a global framework for evaluating proposed research in this area would be a great contribution."

    "Autophagy inhibitors are considered as potent chemosensitizers and might therefore be introduced into combination regimens for optimal anticancer therapies. Methods to measure autophagy include electron microscopy for quantifying autophagosomes, immunoblotting for detecting the lipidation of microtubules-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (also known as LC3), or immunofluorescence microscopy for monitoring the redistribution of LC3 from a diffuse pattern to a punctate one. 41 Complementary techniques are necessary as the autophagosomal accumulation of LC3 can be influenced by lysosomal acidification. For instance, another way is to assess the autophagic flux, thanks to several methods: pulse-chase, immunoblotting, or luciferase-based methods for monitoring the degradation of autophagic substrates. A luciferase coupled with LC3 has recently been used to develop a real-time HTScompatible assay for monitoring the autophagic flux. Moreover, firefly luciferase has been shown to constitute a preferential autophagic substrate and is hence a trustful marker of autophagic degradation that may be applicable to HTS studies. In addition, recent developed assays allow determining the phosphorylation status of substrates from critical autophagy regulator kinases, such as mTORC1 and UNC51-like kinase 1. Besides, several of these assays have been recently adapted for HTS. Finally, these methods should be used to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms of autophagy more than quantifying its levels.

    "The assessment of new potential chemotherapeutics and drug screening involve cell viability and cytotoxicity assays to identify and define safety thresholds for subsequent clinical use. Such assays rely on several cell functions, including enzyme activity, cell membrane activity, cell adherence, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, coenzyme production, and nucleotide uptake activity. If a compound interferes with cellular attachment, causes dramatic morphologic changes, affects cell growth rate, or leads to a reduction in overall viability, it is considered to be cytotoxic. 19 However, cytotoxicity reflects the cell-killing property of a chemical compound and is not associated with a specific cell death pathway. Cell viability can be defined as the number of healthy cells in a sample, without any distinction between cells which are actively dividing or quiescent ones, whereas cell proliferation is the measurement of the M\u00e9ry et al 3 number of cells that are dividing in a culture. Viability assays aim to measure cellular maintenance and survival parameters. Thereby, a myriad of assays have been designed and used so as to measure viability or cytotoxicity in vitro, including, in particular, classical dye inclusion or exclusion and colony formation assays. 20",
    "Cell death plays a crucial role for a myriad of physiological processes, and several human diseases such as cancer are characterized by its deregulation. There are many methods available for both quantifying and qualifying the accurate process of cell death which occurs. Choosing the right assay tool is essential to generate meaningful data, provide sufficient information for clinical applications, and understand cell death processes. In vitro cell death assays are important steps in the search for new therapies against cancer as the ultimate goal remains the elaboration of drugs that interfere with specific cell death mechanisms. However, choosing a cell viability or cytotoxicity assay among the many available options is a daunting task. Indeed, cell death can be approached by several viewpoints and require a more holistic approach. This review provides an overview of cell death assays usually used in vitro for assessing cell death so as to elaborate new potential chemotherapeutics and discusses considerations for using each assay."

    "Among viral pathogen species known to cause human diseases, 76.0% also infect other vertebrate animals [18, 19] . Moreover, a 41.8% seropositive rate against SFTSV has been reported in domestic animals in China, strongly suggesting that animals are major reservoirs of tick-mediated SFTSV transmission [1, 3, 4] . In addition, seropositive shrews and rodents were recently implicated as potential animal hosts susceptible to SFTSV [9] . A study in Korea showed that SFTSV-positive ticks are widespread throughout most provinces, particularly during summer [13] . Moreover, recent evidence has shown that SFTSV acts as a zoonotic pathogen, and further studies of serological prevalence in farming or wild animal species are necessary.",

    "Finally, DPO can be used for any PCR approach which makes use of the ability of primers to specifically hybridize to complementary sequences except for the case of long and accurate PCR (LA-PCR) which is achieved by DNA polymerases having proofreading activity (e.g. Pfu). It was found that such DNA polymerases have a tendency to completely drop off the DNA when they encounter inosine in a PCR primer (20) .",
    "Since the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a variety of modifications in primer design and reaction conditions have been proposed to enhance and optimize specificity (1-3), but a fundamental solution for eliminating non-specific priming still remains a challenge and limits the versatility of PCR in nucleic-acid-based tests (NATs). Achieving a high level of specificity in priming currently requires very rigid primer search parameters and optimization of PCR conditions. Even when these requirements are satisfied, a high risk of nonspecific priming is inevitable.",

    "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause outbreaks in humans as a result of spillover events from dromedaries. In contrast to humans, MERS-CoV-exposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses.

    "MERS-CoV has caused sporadic infections, along with several local outbreaks throughout the Middle East since its discovery in 2012 [25, 26] . Although much remains unknown, closely related viruses have been isolated from camels [27] and highly homologous MERS-like bat CoVs have been identified in African Neoromicia capensis bats [28] . Local surveillance efforts have detected high levels of antibodies that recognize MERS-CoV in dromedary camels [29] ; furthermore, sampling of archived camel serum samples has revealed MERS antibodies from as early as 1992 [30] .

ARDS causes significant morbidity and approximately 40% mortality, resulting in \u223c75 000 deaths/year in the USA alone [2] . In the past two decades, five emerging viruses have been known to cause significant ARDS-related mortality, including influenza H1N1 2009 and, in particular, the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.

    "Two of the earliest Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases were men who had visited the Doha central animal market and adjoining slaughterhouse in Qatar. We show that a high proportion of camels presenting for slaughter in Qatar show evidence for nasal MERS-CoV shedding (62/105). Sequence analysis showed the circulation of at least five different virus strains at these premises, suggesting that this location is a driver of MERS-CoV circulation and a high-risk area for human exposure. No correlation between RNA loads and levels of neutralizing antibodies was observed, suggesting limited immune protection and potential for reinfection despite previous exposure.",
    "To obtain further insight in the diversity of the viruses that circulated in dromedary camels at the slaughterhouse, MERS-CoV strains were sequenced according to a recently developed technique that enables the identification of divergent MERS-CoV types [sequences and technique in (8)]. In total, five different sequence types were identified with three different types found at both sampling moments (Table 2) . Camels either came from the large Al-Shahaniya international racing complex (ASH) or from different sources elsewhere in Qatar (indicated by the initial arrow for animals 6\u00c18 and 10\u00c112 in (Table 2) . Subsequently, they were either brought to a showing area (Al Mazad, AM), to the barns at the CM for a holding period, or immediately sent to the slaughterhouse (SH). Therefore, the sampling for animals 1\u00c15 and 9\u00c113 reflects MERS-CoV sequence diversity as a result of import from other regions in Qatar, whereas virus circulation at the CM more likely explains the virus diversity for animals 6\u00c18."

    "With the demand for rapid and comprehensive detection of multiple agents in clinical diagnostics for humans and animals, single-organism molecular diagnostic methods for pathogen detection are burdensome unless used for large numbers of samples being tested for a single disease. In the veterinary context, high-throughput diagnostic methodologies are particularly important due to the additional need for covering pathogens from a wide variety of species. OneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include a number of bacteria, viruses (DNA or RNA based), parasites, and fungi. The challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together (multiplexing) in order to improve testing efficiency is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays."

In total, 47 individuals infected with H5N1 were identified in China and 30 (63.8%) succumbed to the H5N1 infection (2). H5N1 causes primary viral pneumonia with rapid progression to lung failure following invasion of epithelial cells in the upper and lower respiratory tracts (3) . However, the exact mechanism for elucidating the severity of human H5N1 infection remains unclear. Previously, apoptosis was not only observed in the alveolar epithelial cells of 2 patients who succumbed to H5N1 infection, but was also induced by H5N1 in numerous cell types in vivo and in vitro (4) (5) (6) . These results indicated that apoptosis may be important in H5N1 pathogenesis in the human body."

    "Likewise, the idea that physicians acting as clinical investigators should set aside their primary medical duty and their own therapeutic preferences is particularly daunting when Ebola infected patients die in high numbers. While clinicians would generally accept the idea to test an unproven intervention within the frame of a monitored trial, randomised designs make this situation even more problematic. Unless dictated by scarcity, randomisation was often perceived as a tragic choice for humanitarian workers who could not readily forfeit their therapeutic obligations and wished to maintain patients' trust in such difficult circumstances. The clustering of EVD inside households illustrates this kind of dilemma. When several members of a family attended an isolation facility, their random allocation to different regimens was emotionally difficult and felt as morally problematic [Annick Antierens, personal communication]. In addition, randomisation adds unnecessary burdens to the management of EVD patients, and additional risks of nosocomial accidents. 34 ",
    "One could deplore that none of the promising treatments used in Ebola field trials could so far be convincingly confirmed as curative. 52 Regardless, with their variable merits and shortcomings, those emergency clinical trials conducted in the course of a major epidemic could collectively contribute to building pragmatic foundations of disaster research ethics. This exercise would be more meaningful if ethicists and social scientists seized the opportunity to bring the voice of victims, investigators, clinicians and survivors into ethical debates that have too often been disembodied and rhetorical."

    "Nidoviruses are characterized by their distinct polycistronic genome organization, the conservation of key replicative enzymes, and a common genome expression and replication strategy (8) (Figure 1 ). Their distinctive transcription mechanism involves the synthesis of a variable set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, which are 3 coterminal with the viral genome (reviewed in (9, 10) ). In most nidoviruses, sg mRNAs and genome also share a common 5 leader sequence. The synthesis of sg mRNAs (transcription) and genome RNA (replication) is performed by a poorly characterized replication-transcription complex (RTC) that is comprised of multiple protein subunits (reviewed in (11, 12, 13) ) encoded in two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the nidoviral genomic RNA ( Figure 1A ). The two polyproteins (pp), pp1a and pp1ab, the latter resulting from ribosomal frameshifting during genome translation, are auto-catalytically processed by multiple cognate proteases, one of which (the 3C-like (3CL pro ) or main (M pro ) protease) is responsible for the large majority of cleavages (14) . Downstream of ORF1b, nidovirus genomes contain multiple smaller ORFs, known as the 3 ORFs (7), which are expressed from the sg mRNAs described above."

Thus, the diagnosis of HPeV-3 infection is difficult based only on clinical signs."

    "In this study, we document a case of phenobarbital-induced anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS), which has been rarely reported in veterinary medicine. A 2-yearold, 5.4 kg, neutered male Russian Blue cat was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and started on phenobarbital treatment. Eight days after initiation of phenobarbital treatment, the cat showed tachypnea and hyperthermia. CBC and serum biochemistry were unremarkable. However, the patient showed high serum amyloid A (SAA). On abdominal ultrasonography, generalized enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes and splenic multiple hypo-echoic nodules, which were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy were found. The cat was diagnosed with AHS, and phenobarbital was discontinued. After 10 days of cessation, the patient had normal SAA, and clinical signs were resolved.",
    "Case reports of AHS in cats have been previously published. Baho et al. reported that a 4-year-old female shorthair cat had lymph node enlargement after four days of phenobarbital administration. Subsequently, the medication was changed from phenobarbital to levetiracetam, and the size of the lymph nodes were decreased after 10 days [1] . In another report, lymph node enlargement was observed after four weeks of phenobarbital administration in a 2-year-old female shorthair cat. Phenobarbital was replaced with levetiracetam, and no lymph node enlargement was observed after 10 days [8] . Although mild symptoms of AHS can be self-limiting, AHS in dogs or cats should be monitored carefully [1, 7] .",
    "After 8 days of phenobarbital use, no seizure symptoms were observed. Nevertheless, the patient was admitted into hospital due to high fever and lethargy. The body temperature at the time of admission was 40.1\u00b0C (reference range, 37.4-39.2\u00b0C). There was no specific finding on CBC, and no abnormal findings were found in serum chemistry analysis. SAA reached a high of 179 mg/l (reference range, 0-5 mg/l) and a small number of D\u00f6hle bodies in the white blood cells were observed on blood smear evaluation. Abdominal ultrasonography showed splenomegaly and enlargement of the abdominal (colic; 1.14 \u00d7 0.69 mm, ileocecal; 0.85 \u00d7 0.47 mm, pancreaticoduodenal; 11.37 \u00d7 6.98 mm) lymph nodes. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed under ultrasound guidance, and a provisional diagnosis of reactive lymphadenopathy was made (Fig. 1) . Also, we could not find any evidence of infection or tumor by history taking, physical examination, blood analysis, and imaging. Although the serum concentration of phenobarbital was not measured at this time, through an evaluation of the clinical course, a diagnosis was made of hypersensitivity due to phenobarbital, the prescribed anticonvulsant drug."

    "Then how can we explain case reports documenting the over 40% of transmission of influenza and SARS to nontribe passengers? Some transmissions may have occurred while waiting in the airport, while boarding, or while deplaning. Alternatively, some passengers may have been infected by other sources before or after the flight. Three of the five flights in these case reports range from 9.5 to 14 h, providing many more opportunities for transmission. Other transmissions may have occurred via fomites. Flyers can protect themselves from fomite transmission by exercising careful hand hygiene. Finally, our model assumes that droplets are the main transmission route for influenza and SARS. This assumption is based on general public health agency guidance to health care providers, but it may not be true: significant transmission may also occur via smaller virus-laden particles (the smallest being aerosols), which have larger dispersion distances.",
    "Thus, there was no obvious virus shedding into the cabin. Furthermore, the airline's cabin-cleaning policy is to disinfect all hard surfaces whenever the plane \"overnights,\" and all surface samples were taken from hard surfaces. Not all flights were the first of the day for that plane. We chose to sample seat-belt buckles, believing that these would be the most likely items to be touched and the least likely to be thoroughly disinfected.",
    "Unlike droplets that fall to the ground quickly, aerosols could remain suspended in cabin air until they are breathed or drawn into the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system and putatively trapped by high-efficiency particulate air filters. Transmission via aerosols could also occur during the period between when the cabin door closes and take-off. Our model is not applicable to other aerosol-transmitted diseases, such as tuberculosis (18) , varicella, and measles (19) . Our model assumes omnidirectional transmission and does not take into account seat backs as barriers. Thus, our simulation results may be overestimating risk of direct droplet-mediated transmission."

    "ED presentation for ARIs is common and has an enormous impact on the healthcare system. We have provided a comprehensive analysis of the ED burden across WA using population-based data linkage. These data from EDs across geographical areas provide essential information for ED planning, both within season and by site and to use when exploring the impact of specific interventions (eg, vaccination) or modifications to community health services (eg, establishing general practitioner after-hours clinics). Notwithstanding the limitations of clinical diagnostic accuracy, these data provide a more community-based level of the ARI burden of disease to complement previous studies assessing only hospitalisation and death at the tip of the burden of disease pyramid. There is a lack of primary healthcare data with diagnostic information in the community in general, and these ED data will be important for understanding where to target prevention strategies and form the baseline for evaluating policies.

    "The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "Ongoing H5N1 circulation has appropriately resulted in a focus on sequencing viral genomes to understand the evolution of these viruses and the significance of observed genetic changes. Expanded laboratory capacity for high-throughput Sanger sequencing and recent technological advances, such as nextgeneration sequencing and parallel computing, have revolutionized the quantity, quality, and availability of gene sequences and our ability to quickly and accurately analyze these data (3) . Consequently, the number of animal and human influenza virus sequences available in publically accessible databases has dramatically increased over the years, as have the bioinformatics tools required for efficient investigation (4, 5) . These advances in laboratory and analytical methods provide strong incentives to utilize molecular data for pandemic risk assessment of zoonotic influenza viruses at the animal-human interface (6) .",
    "As coordination of international surveillance activities and global sharing of viruses improve (especially in the wake of the 2009 pandemic and emergence of H7N9 viruses in China), molecularly based surveillance has great potential for rapid risk assessment of samples collected as part of active and passive surveillance systems. Real-time feedback to investigators in the field or authorities making policy decisions related to poultry outbreak containment, clinical intervention, and diagnostic methodology, to cite a few examples, will remain critical in the future. In addition, as building laboratory capacity is prioritized in countries impacted the most by endemic H5N1 virus circulation and the higher incidence of human infection, the ability to screen viruses for amino acid markers or lineage-associated molecular determinants by sequencing, pyrosequencing, mass spectrometry, and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays will become the reality for more and more laboratories."

    "T he secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells is composed of a series of membrane-bound organelles, each with its own unique complement of components. Transport of components between these organelles is achieved by means of vesicular transport, which results in a flow of membrane traffic throughout the pathway (Rothman, 1994) . To maintain its identity, an organelle must ensure that its resident proteins do not get swept with those proteins passing through en route to other destinations in the cell. To achieve this localization, resident proteins can either be retrieved once they have exited the organelle, or they may be prevented from ever leaving that organelle in the first place . These two mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive, since efficient localization of a protein to an organelle could arise through a combination of both mechanisms."

In this way, all members of society will benefit.",
    "Another big challenge to vaccination today is that most vaccines are delivered by needle injection. This often results in local mild reactions and these minor adverse events are being used as a reason to dissuade individuals not to vaccinate their children. Indeed, in our society, all forms of 'preventive medicine' are looked upon less favorably than therapies. Many of our therapeutic drugs cause significantly greater adverse reactions than vaccines. However, they are accepted because they are treatments. Anti-cancer drugs are one of the best examples, which may have many side effects. The reason for this dichotomy is that our society is much less accepting of preventative medicine versus therapeutic approaches to disease management. If the focus continues to favor expensive therapeutics over economic preventative medicine, escalating costs of health care will bankrupt society."

    "An interaction of m 7 G capped transcripts with the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) is important for promoting correct splicing 14 and 3'end formation 15 . After export from the nucleus, translation of most mRNAs is initiated with the recognition of the m 7 G cap by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) 16 . This cap binding step is usually rate-limiting for translation. The m 7 G cap also protects the message from 5' to 3' exonuclease digestion. Compared to the well characterised role of m 7 G, relatively little is known regarding the function of 2' ribose methylation on the following nucleotides. The presence of a cap1 structure may promote binding to ribosomes 17 and can increase translational efficiency in vitro 18, 19 . Many animal viruses encode their own cap1 methylases 20, 21 and this may also help them to limit host immune responses 22, 23 . Whilst viral cap1 methylases are common viral cap2 methylases and m 6 Am methylases have not been reported. However, m 6 Am and cap2 structures can be found in viral mRNAs in vivo, presumably as a result of the action of the host cell's enzymes 24 . The functional consequences for an mRNA of possessing m 6 Am in a cap1 or a cap2 structure are not known."

Additionally, macrophages that arise from the differentiation of monocytes recruited from the blood to inflamed tissues play a central role in regulating local inflammation. Studies of macrophage activation in the last decade or so have revealed that these cells adopt a staggering range of phenotypes that are finely tuned responses to a variety of different stimuli, and that the resulting subsets of activated macrophages play critical roles in both progression and resolution of disease. This review summarizes the current understanding of the contributions of differentially polarized macrophages to various infectious and inflammatory diseases and the ongoing effort to develop novel therapies that target this key aspect of macrophage biology."

    "Viruses are divided into two similar-sized groups depending on whether the virus particle contains DNA or RNA, and, as causes of human fatality, RNA viruses are by far the more important (1) . New viral diseases continue to appear as a result of several changes in human activity: travel, population growth, interaction with wild habitats etc. Well-known novel, or emergent, RNA diseases include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (3), and may come to include Avian influenza H5N1 virus (4) . These emergent diseases are an important factor behind the increase in the number of genome sequences that NCBI treats as representing new species (Figure 1 ). In 2005, more than 200 new virus species were submitted to GenBank (more recent dates are less reliable because there is typically a delay between submission and public availability). As more emergent viruses appear, it is important to have a site that allows their genomes to be compared to those of known viruses. The origin of most major infectious diseases is unknown because of our ignorance of the diversity of pathogens in wild animals. This restricts our ability to both predict risks and develop treatments (5) .",
    "We intend to update the database on at least a 6-monthly basis in order to include newly discovered viruses, and are currently working to incorporate biological and epidemiological data. We also intend to release soon a DNA virus database using the same format. As discussed in Introduction, we are keen to collaborate with other groups over further developments of our database. ",
    "Despite some advances (6, 7) , the evolutionary history of RNA viruses is in general poorly known, especially the deep phylogenetic relationships between virus families (8, 9) . We believe that one of the reasons for this is a lack of easily available translated genes and genomes for all species, and the lack of aligned genome sequences representing different isolates of the same species."

    "The ratio of mature to immature prM depends on a variety of factors, including the producer cell type and the flavivirus species. For example, dengue viruses are known to release high amounts of immature or partially mature viruses, most likely because of a conserved acidic residue within the furin recognition site 78 (Table 2) . Importantly, the content of prM in viral particles also affects antibody recognition and consequently antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection. 77 Thus, furin-mediated protein processing may once again markedly affect the outcome of infection.",
    "Although the therapeutic application of furin inhibitors may be full of pitfalls, it is certainly a promising approach that should be further pursued. Future studies will elucidate the role of individual PCSKs and their substrates in disease progression and a better understanding of cellular pathways regulating furin activity may uncover additional targets for therapeutic intervention.",
    "Furin is a member of the evolutionarily ancient family of proprotein convertases. Their similarity with bacterial subtilisin and yeast kexin proteases has coined the abbreviation PCSK (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type). Humans encode nine members of this protease family (PCSK1-9), with PCSK3 representing furin (Table 1) . PCSKs are well known for their ability to activate other cellular proteins. The proteolytic conversion of inactive precursor proteins into bioactive molecules has already been described in the 1960s. 3 However, it took more than 20 years until furin was identified as the first mammalian proprotein convertase. 4, 5 To date, more than 200 cellular substrates of PCSKs have been described, including hormones, receptors, growth factors and adhesion molecules.",
    "Because of the key role of furin in the pathogenesis of cancer and infectious diseases, its suitability as a therapeutic target has raised significant interest for several years. Many laboratories have explored the possibility to limit tumor growth, viral replication or bacterial intoxication by reducing the amount or proteolytic activity of furin."

The incorporation of relevant ethical principles in pandemic planning can help enhance voluntary cooperation based upon public trust, and reduce the undesirable outcomes of public health measures [1] .",
    "In Korea, public health ethics is not an established field. Bioethics was introduced to Korea in the 1990s, mostly in the form of clinical ethics and research ethics programs in medical schools and hospitals. From the beginning, the principalism proposed in Beauchamp and Childress's Principles of Biomedical Ethics [6] played a dominant role in biomedical ethics education in Korea. With the four principles of respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice, this liberal indi-vidualistic ethical frame was established for patient-health professional relationships based on the premise that patients are pure autonomous agents. Korea legally codified considerations regarding research ethics within a very short period of time. Enacted in 2005 to regulate genetic and embryo research, the Bioethics and Safety Act of Korea was revised in 2013 to mandate informed consent and ethics review for research on human subjects, including public health research. Enforcement of the Bioethics and Safety Act has promoted the awareness of individual rights and interests in research. Although Korea is a family-oriented, collectively-minded society holding strong communitarian values, the individualist libertarian approach imported from Western societies has been dominant in the field of biomedical ethics."

The results presented are for the semi-nested RT-PCR-based Paramyxovirinae detection system. Samples shown in this table were collected from the spleens of Eidolon helvum fruit bats. ",
    "In this study, we describe the detection of novel paramyxoviruses from the Eidolon helvum species of fruit bats. We extracted RNA from 312 spleen samples from bats captured in Zambia over a period of 4 years (2008)(2009)(2010)(2011). Semi-nested RT-PCR detected a total of 25 (8%) positive samples for paramyxoviruses which were then directly sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic analysis. Among the positive samples, seven novel paramyxoviruses were detected. Five viruses were closely related to the genus Henipavirus, while two viruses were related to the unclassified Bat paramyxoviruses from Ghana and Congo Brazzaville. Our study identified novel Henipavirus-related and unrelated viruses using RT-PCR in fruit bats from Kansaka National Park and indicated the presence of similar Bat paramyxoviruses originating from wide geographic areas, suggesting the ability of bats to harbor and transmit viruses. The presence of these viruses in fruit bats might pose a public health risk."

    "Emerging new concepts have recently highlighted the need for a novel approach to our understanding of macrophage response. [34] [35] [36] Similar to T lymphocytes, which feature numerous cellular subtypes, macrophages also differentiate into several phenotypes. 37, 38 Cells belonging to distinct phenotypes are distinguished by expression of groups of markers that define each phenotype. Thorough elucidation of these groups of markers, or panels, has revealed that these phenotypes are distinguished by expression differences in chemokines, chemokine receptors, enzymes, costimulatory molecules, Toll receptors, cytokines, and cytokine receptors. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] M1 macrophages express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the primary marker that confirms the response of these cells in a specific disease (Table 1) . [44] [45] [46] However, a surface marker that defines the identity of M1 macrophages has not yet been identified.",

    "Among the phenotypes of M2 macrophages, M2a, M2b, and M2c macrophages are characterized by the presence of arginase (Arg). [47] [48] [49] These subpopulations express a cell-surface scavenger receptor that recognizes haptoglobin-hemoglobin complexes used to identify M2 macrophages and is labeled with CD163. Moreover, a previously unrecognized subpopulation of M2 macrophages, M2d, has been described, but the molecules responsible for the differentiation of M0 macrophages into M2d macrophages remain unknown. However, this population participates in the angiogenesis response, producing interleukin (IL)-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor (Table 1) .

[53] [54] [55] [56] Mreg macrophages respond to the stimulation of Treg cells and are responsible for inducing the repair response and inhibiting triggering of mechanisms that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in tissue lesions.

    "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is one of the most prevalent cattle diseases, causing large economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. For example, BRDC is estimated to account for 70-80% of all feedlot cattle morbidity and 40-50% of all cattle mortality, resulting in a loss of greater than US $500 million per year in the United States [16, 22] . In Japan, number of illness in the statistics mutual aid for livestock owners in 2014 reported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries indicate that respiratory diseases accounted for 23% of illness in cattle (http://www.maff.go.jp/j/tokei/kouhyou/katiku_kyosai/) (in Japanese). Despite considerable research and attempts to manage hygiene to prevent BRDC, these measures have had a limited effect on reducing the impacts of this disease [29] .",
    "One of the difficulties in investigation and prevention of BRDC is its multi-factorial etiology, based on host interactions with multiple pathogens, such as virus and bacteria, including mycoplasma. The primary viral infection sometimes results in clinical symptoms, and it was exacerbated by secondary infections with bacterial pathogens [10] . Stressors, such as transportation, and host factors, such as nutritional status, raise the risk and severity of BRDC [17, 28] . Viruses, which are commonly associated with",
    "BRDC, include bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), and bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV 3) and 7 (BAdV 7) [12, 28] . In addition, a metagenomic approach to BRDC in cattle recently revealed that several other viruses may be involved in BRDC, such as influenza D virus (IDV), bovine rhinitis A virus (BRAV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) [13, 23] . Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Trueperella pyogenes and Mycoplasma bovis are bacteria consistently associated with BRDC [1, 11] . Ureaplasma diversum has also been isolated from BRDC cattle [8] . Infection with each single pathogen does not necessarily result in appearance of symptoms, but complex infections with a variety of pathogens, including the indigenous agents, develop severe conditions. Such multiple pathogens infection make it difficult to identify the etiology of BRDC rapidly.",
    "Compared with one assay-one pathogen test, Dembo respiratory-PCR can identified a wide range of existing pathogens quickly and easily. Considering multiple etiology of BRDC, screening by Dembo respiratory-PCR would help determining treatment and prevention measures. This detection system may provide an alternative testing method that is simpler, earlier and more comprehensive than existing assays."

    "Another well-studied example of -1PRF is on the dnaX mRNA of E. coli. The slippery site contains the SS motif A 1 AAA 4 AAG 7 encoding two Lys (AAA and AAG) in 0-frame, the downstream SL and an SDlike sequence upstream of the SS (Fig. 1A) [39, 55, 56] .",
    "The SS1 of HIV-1 was also reported to support -2PRF [16] . Because in those experiments, the frameshifting sequence was placed into an unnatural context followed by an antisense oligonucleotide-binding site, we were prompted to study the extent of alternative slippages on the native gag-pol mRNA frameshifting site [69] . HIV-1 gag-pol SS1 indeed allows -2 and even +1 slippage, but their contribution to the overall frameshifting efficiency becomes significant only when certain aa-tRNAs are omitted. Thus, alternative slippages on SS1 must follow the 'hungry' route of frameshifting.",
    "Here -1PRF likely proceeds via the one-tRNA (or 'hungry') slippage mechanism, as discussed above for dnaX, HIV-1 gag-pol (FFR) and SFV 6K (FFS). Interestingly, tRNA Gln(CUG) shows tissue-specific expression levels in humans, and the lowest concentration of this tRNA was detected in the brain region called striatum, which is the primary site for Huntington's disease [81] . In summary, the low level of the target tRNA is linked to the increased frameshifting levels and accumulation of the mutated huntingtin protein, thereby contributing to the disease severity in Huntington's patients."

    "Our findings illustrate how global health security, which relies on the capacity of all countries to rapidly detect and control public health threats, is critical to the US economy. Our analysis provides data that policymakers can use when deciding on programs to improve the prevention, detection, and response to outbreaks around the world and thereby help enhance global health security.",
    "For estimates of impact due to larger epidemics, McKibbin and Sidorenko 16 produced a wide range of estimates of economic impact for influenza pandemics of differing severity. These estimates ranged from approximately 1% for a ''mild'' pandemic (1968-like) to an average of approximately 8.3% for a ''severe'' pandemic (1918-like). The country-specific estimates of GDP losses for the latter scenario included 9.2% for Indonesia, 19.3% for the Philippines, and 26.8% for Hong Kong. These country-specific estimates are similar to the Ebola-related impact on GDP measured in West Africa (Table 2 ).",
    "Obviously, there is a great deal of variability from country to country and, over time, in the correlation between economic growth and trade. Assuming a lower impact of an infectious disease outbreak is, in our model, equivalent to assuming a less than 1-to-1 correlation between GDP and trade (see sensitivity analysis below)."

    "Recombination is an important process which expedites selection in many organisms (Muller 1932 ) by unlinking loci. It also leads to different parts of recombining genomes to have different histories which, if not properly accounted for, can interfere with many genetic analyses, of which phylogenetic methods are among the most sensitive. Not accounting for recombination in phylogenetic analyses leads to incorrect (Schierup and Hein 2000) and poorly supported genealogies (Posada and Crandall 2002) and false inference of selection (Anisimova, Nielsen, and Yang 2003; Shriner et al. 2003) .",

    "Viruses are particulate in nature and usually exist in different morphological forms that generally range in size from 20 to 900 nm [11] [12] [13] . Their intact, mature infectious particles are typically composed of definite units of proteins and nucleic acid that self-assemble to form nanoparticulate structures called virions. The viral proteins are usually arranged in a surface layer called the capsid and sometimes in an outer envelope surrounding an inner core of nucleic acids.

Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that are pleomorphic in shape (spherical and 120-160 nm or bacilliform and 170-200 nm by 75-88 nm). They have a relatively large, positive-sense, ssRNA genome of 27-32 kb that encodes four to five structural proteins (S, the spike glycoprotein; M, the membrane glycoprotein; N, the nucleocapsid interrupt phosphoprotein; E, the envelope protein; and HE, the hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein) and 2 nonstructural polyprotein precursors (pp1a, polyprotein 1a; and pp1ab, polyprotein 1ab), which are later processed into several other nonstructural proteins and viral polymerase [113, 114] .",

    "The Bunyaviridae family comprises more than 300 members that are primarily organized into four main genera: Hantavirus, Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus and Nairovirus [99] . Bunyaviruses are spherical, enveloped RNA viruses 80-100 nm in size. Their genome is composed of three segments of negative-sense, ssRNA: a large segment (L, 6.3-12 kb) that encodes RNA polymerase, a medium segment (M, 3.5-6 kb) that encodes viral glycoprotein, and a small segment (S, 1-2.2 kb) that encodes nucleocapsid protein [100] . These viruses are diverse in their host range and are frequently involved in a wide range of diseases in plants, animals, and humans. Human pathogenic bunyaviruses, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Hantaan virus, La Crosse virus, Oropouche virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Toscana virus, continue to present increasingly important health concerns worldwide [101, 102] .",
    "RVFV is an arthropod-borne pathogen primarily known to affect animals and later discovered to infect humans. RVFV infection in humans can progress to serious hemorrhagic fevers that often lead to death, with prominent mortality rates of up to 10-12%. Infected persons can also develop other clinical manifestations, including retinitis, encephalitis, and paralysis [106, 107] . RVFV is historically endemic to Africa and has had a long history of outbreaks ranging from its reemergence in Egypt in 1977 to the most recent outbreak in South Africa in 2011 [108, 109] . Thus far, RVFV outbreaks are unpredictable and usually associated with very high socio-economic and public health consequences [110, 111] . Therefore, diagnostic methods that can rapidly identify the virus have become crucial not only for avoiding and preventing such outbreaks but also for monitoring cross-border dissemination."

The diluted assayed plasma sample, supplemented with calcium, factor Xa, and thrombin inhibitors were introduced into 1 of the microplate wells coated with streptavidin and biotinylated annexin V, and then incubated. The phospholipid concentration is the limiting factor in this ELISA test. Even if flow cytometry is considered the \"gold standard\" of microparticle detection, there are still technical limitations concerning detection of small microparticles (100 nm to 500 nm). Therefore, microparticle activity can be analyzed by prothrombinase assay (ELISA), which is easily performed and shows a significant correlation of results (20) ."

    "Objectives and design: Developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine that elicits broadly neutralizing HIV-1 human antibodies (bnAbs) remains a challenging goal. Extensive studies on HIV-1 have revealed various strategies employed by the virus to escape host immune surveillance. Here, we investigated the human antibody gene repertoires of uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals at genomic DNA (gDNA) and cDNA levels by deep sequencing followed by high-throughput sequence analysis to determine the frequencies of putative germline antibody genes of known HIV-1 monoclonal bnAbs (bnmAbs).",
    "Methods: Combinatorial gDNA and cDNA antibody libraries were constructed using the gDNAs and mRNAs isolated from uninfected and HIV-1-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All libraries were deep sequenced and sequences analysed using IMGT/HighV-QUEST software (http://imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/index. action). The frequencies of putative germline antibodies of known bnmAbs in the gDNA and cDNA libraries were determined.",
    "Preparation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells The PBMCs of healthy volunteers were obtained from The University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China).

PBMCs from patients 2 and 3 (pt2 and pt3) were obtained from National Center for AIDS/ STD Control and Prevention, China CDC (Beijing, China). All these experiments were approved by ethical committees of the respective institutes, and conducted according to local guidelines and regulations. All three patients were elite controllers. Pt1 was infected with clade B virus whose serum exhibited high titres of broadly neutralizing activity, and a panel of bnmAbs were isolated from pt1 PBMCs by single memory B-cell sorting using gp120 C-C core protein as a bait (pt1 in [18, 28] ). Pt2 and pt3 were infected with clade B' virus and naive to antiretroviral therapy [30] . The sera of pt2 and pt3 also exhibited cross-clade neutralization activity (data not shown). Heparinized whole blood samples were used to isolate human PBMCs by Ficoll density gradient separation."

Additionally, the increases observed in circulating levels of the HMGB1 protein were positively correlated with the severity of the disease in human and animal models. Complete inhibition or neutralization of HMGB1 may attenuate the severity of these diseases, decrease the incidence of organ dysfunction and improve survival, and consequently there is a burgeoning interest in HMGB1 as a therapeutic target. Among the strategies investigated, agents which bind to HMGB1 and neutralize its activity, including antibodies raised against HMGB1 and molecules which inhibit HMGB1 activation or its interaction with specific receptors, are gathering attention.",

    "Low profitability is one of the reasons for the lack of vaccine and treatment research and development in developing countries. However, recent DENV research developments in Southeast Asia and India have led to remarkable economic growth and increased efforts to combat infectious diseases. Thus, the demand for vaccine development has increased, and more research is now in progress. The DENV vaccine market is expected to reach a combined $398.6 million in Brazil, India, Mexico, Singapore, and Thailand in 2020 [36] , and if optimal vaccines are developed using appropriate disease models, there will be a significant economic impact that could be extended to Zika virus and West Nile virus in the future.",

Until now, all cases of DENV infection in Korea have been shown to be imported, and >95% of patients had returned to Korea after being infected in Southeast Asia or South Asia. However, as the domestic climate becomes more subtropical, these subtropical insects can survive much longer, and the possible occurrence of subtropical mosquitoes may result in an influx of DENV in South Korea.",
    "DENV-susceptible mouse models have been developed by genetically modifying the immune system to maintain the infected state. However, this model has limitations related to the immune response, and it is not applicable to all DENV serotypes. At present, there are no experimental models that reflect the pathological characteristics and clinical symptoms in humans, in part because DENV only infects apes and people. The use of primate species as experimental models also has limitations, including the high cost and challenges of managing them, and such models are not appropriate in certain situations, since they present viremia without clinical symptoms."

    "Recent studies show that cellular UPR can be induced by infection of various viruses, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (13) , West Nile virus (14) , Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (15) , hepatitis C virus (16, 17) , human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (18, 19) , dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2) (20) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (21) , coronavirus (22) , Epstein-Barr virus (23) and Semliki Forest virus (24) . Some viruses, such as JEV and DEN-2, use the ER of host cells as the primary site of glycoprotein synthesis, genomic RNA replication and virus particle maturation, and thus trigger ER stress as well as UPR (15, 20) . In the other case, some viral proteins, such as HCMV US11, traffic to the ER of host cells and induce UPR (18) . The transactivator of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Tax, has been shown to be localized in the organelles associated with protein secretion including ER and Golgi complex (25) , raising the possibility that HTLV-1 may affect cellular UPR as well. We previously discovered that XBP-1S stimulates basal and Tax-activated transcription of HTLV-1. Infection of HTLV-1 was found to induce UPR and up-regulation the expression of several UPR genes, including XBP-1. Furthermore, XBP-1 was identified as one of the Tax target genes in cells (26) . Our results not only revealed a positive feedback loop between HTLV-1 and the host cells, but also suggested an important role for XBP-1 in transcriptional regulation of HTLV-1.",
    "293T cells were transiently co-transfected with indicated expression plasmids and the cell lysates were prepared 2 days post-transfection for co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). To get the high levels of ectopic expression, 293T, a highly transfectable derivative of HEK293, was chosen for the Co-IP study. The IP kit was purchased from Roche and Co-IP was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by western blotting. Western blotting was carried out according to the standard protocols. All the antibodies used in our study were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, except the anti-HA antibody (Sigma)."

    "Hemagglutinin, an envelope glycoprotein of some enveloped viruses, can adsorb to erythrocytes. In the presence of virus particles, erythrocytes clump together as a result of the interaction between hemagglutinin and erythrocytes, leading to a lattice formation [5] . Hemagglutination (HA) assessment has been widely used for detecting and quantifying viruses that cause red blood agglutination, such as orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and encephalomyocarditis virus [6] . Some viruses of the family Coronaviridae, such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and PEDV, have been shown to possess the ability to hemagglutinate erythrocytes [7] .",

PDCoV was first identified in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012, while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in the United States in 2014 [3] . Subsequently, PDCoV was detected in Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, indicating that it is widespread among the world's pig populations; moreover, PDCoV can have devastating effects on the swine industry [4] . However, no treatments or vaccines are available for PDCoV."

    "The affected lungs showed severe consolidation with tissue consistency approximating that of the liver (Fig. 1 A) . The SARS lungs were, on average, three to four times heavier than normal lungs. Conventional light microscopy (LM) demonstrated widespread damage of the lung parenchyma, with extensive fibrin exudate, edema, interstitial thickening, and extensive hyaline membrane formation (Fig. 1 B) . There was extensive alveolar collapse, and the remaining alveoli were filled with fluid and desquamated alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial hyperplasia was evident. Large syncytial cells with multiple nuclei were present. Small vessel vasculitis was seen. However, cellular infiltrate was rare and conspicuously absent in most cases, and lymphocytic infiltration was sparse. Overall, the diffuse alveolar damage resembled that seen in adult respiratory distress syndrome, but with a paucity of inflammatory infiltrate.",
    "Infection of neurons seemed to occur in only selected areas of the brain in all eight cases. The scattered red degeneration of the neurons is a sign of neuronal hypoxia/ischemia. The observation of virus in neurons may provide an explanation for the higher than usual incidence of neuronal and psychologic abnormalities that are seen in patients who have late-stage SARS (22, 23) . These neurologic symptoms previously were attributed to negative social pressure during the epidemic.",
    "Previously, there were reports that immune overreaction played a role in the immune injury and pathogenesis of SARS. However, there has been no concrete evidence to support this notion. The data on lymphokine production in SARS was not conclusive, and there was no report of a uniform and consistent increase of lymphocytes in those patients. The release of respiratory symptoms following steroid treatment (19) could be attributed to the antiinflammatory effect of the therapies, rather than immune suppression. Although the role of immune hyperreaction, particularly in the early phase of the diseases, could not be ruled out completely, the evidence that we obtained points more to a direct immune injury as an important component in SARS pathology and pathogenesis.",
    "The target organ of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is widely believed to be the lungs, hence the names \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" and \"SARS atypical pneumonia\" (1, 2) . However, patients often have evidence of other organ dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms (3), abnormal liver function (4, 5) , splenic atrophy, and lymphadenopathy (6) . This may reflect widespread immunopathology or the presence of extrapulmonary SARS-coronavirus (CoV) dissemination and replication, as has been observed in other species infected with animal coronavirus (7) . Recent reports of multiple organ infection by the virus were based mostly on partial autopsies (8) . A comprehensive theory of pathogenesis for this newly emerged infectious disease is lacking."

    "5 -CUG-3 in S. cerevisiae explains why glutamine is preferentially incorporated at UAA compared to UAG, despite the same non-conventional G-U base pairing that forms upon decoding. The modification of the tRNA bases within the anticodon or in its vicinity affects its ability to read stop codons (34, 55) . The prevalence of readthrough varies between organisms. Analysis of the stop codon contexts of 12 Drosophila species and ribosome profiling studies suggested potential readthrough in several hundred Drosophila genes (44, 56) . However, similar genomic analyses and profiling studies of human genes have so far found only a few candidate genes (44, 56, 57) . Computational analysis of readthrough protein isoforms suggests that these are mostly long, modular proteins with intrinsically disordered C-termini of low sequence complexity (58, 59) . The lack of a structurally ordered C-terminus might provide conformational flexibility that allows the readthrough extensions to perform functions without distorting the native protein. The majority of readthrough genes identified in D. melanogaster have regulatory roles, and appending a functional C-terminal extension may confer conditional advantage to protein function."

Many questions regarding the epidemiology of the virus remain unanswered, highlighting the importance of continued surveillance and research on MERS-CoV. To our knowledge, this is the first exploratory study of MERS-CoV in the general population using already established sentinel networks. Data obtained through active surveillance for MERS-CoV may be helpful for the global monitoring of the virus.

    "Ebola virus (EBOV) is an emerging pathogen causing severe, often lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. Despite significant progress, there are no licensed therapeutics to treat or prevent associated disease [1] . EBOV is a filamentous enveloped virus belonging to the family Filoviridae. The virion surface is studded with homotrimeric glycoprotein complexes, which are the sole viral determinant of binding to host cell receptors [2] . The majority of EBOV particles enter cells through macropinocytosis and subsequently traffic through endocytic compartments before release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm, where genome replication takes place [3, 4] ."

    "In addition to bioaerosol sample collection and handling methods, environmental conditions can also influence the viability of airborne viruses and downstream virus recovery. For example, prolonged sampling periods can compromise stability of virus-laden aerosols and result in decreased viral recovery. 12 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the survival of airborne influenza virus depends on ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH) and ultraviolet radiation levels. 13 Specifically, infectivity of influenza in a simulated examination room was reported to be the highest at 7-23% RH, moderate at 57% RH and lowest at 43% RH. 14 Although we did not record temperature and RH at our sampling site, a previous bioaerosol study recorded levels ranging from 54% to 68% RH in three different hospitals in Singapore. 11 High RH levels in Singapore could explain the low percentage of influenza A viruspositive aerosol samples in our study."

    "Across the different approaches, vaccination plays a critical and often cost-effective role in reducing antibiotic use by reducing the incidence and severity of high-impact diseases. However against certain respiratory diseases in cattle, yet it may be more economical to treat diseased animals with therapeutic doses of antibiotics when the need arises.",
    "To help ensure judicious antibiotic use, there is increasingly greater veterinary oversight. In 2014, the American Association of Avian Pathologists and the American Veterinary Medicine Association issued guidelines for judicious antibiotic use on poultry farms, guidelines including veterinary oversight, diagnostic testing prior to antibiotic administration, and treating \"as small a population as possible\" with \"as specific an antibiotic as possible\" for the indicated disease. 46 There are also greater efforts to educate independent producers that are not part of vertically integrated systems and who may have less veterinary oversight. The Pork Quality Assurance Plus program, revised in 2013, educates producers about strategies to reduce the level of antibiotic residue on farms and in food animal products. 47",
    "The most established approach to reducing antibiotic use in animal agriculture is through strategic management of poultry flocks and swine and cattle herds. This approach is multifaceted; there is no one single management practice that producers rely on, but instead a combination of practices, including stringent sanitation, waste management, biosecurity, vaccination programs, highquality nutrition, disease surveillance, and vector control at multiple stages of the production chain. The poultry industry is particularly conducive to this type of management because of the degree of vertical integration within the industry and the greater control at each production stage that this structure provides."

Because of possible complications and reported difficulties in the interpretation of test results, 1-3 the modified water deprivation test (MWDT) was delayed and the cat was treated with desmopressin, a synthetic analog of the natural antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin. First, oral tablets (0.2 mg desmopressin acetate; Watson Pharma) were administered at 0.05 mg q12h. Owing to continual polydipsia and hyposthenuria, therapy was stopped after 10 days and a week later 0.1 mg/ml compounded desmopressin eye drops (0.01% desmopressin acetate; Diamondback Drugs) were administered at a dose of 1-2 drops into the conjunctival sac twice daily for 10 days. Both forms of desmopressin failed to decrease water consumption or increase the USG above untreated levels (Table 1) ; therefore, therapy was discontinued."

    "A total of 282 feline specimens were simultaneously tested using the RDT kit. Presence of FeLV infections in the samples was confirmed by conventional PCR. As shown in Table 2 ",
    "The RDT was started by loading 10 \u03bcL of blood specimen into the hole of the cassette device, and then loading three drops (approximately 100 \u03bcL) of 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 0.1% casein and 1% Tween-20 onto the sample pad. Approximately 20 min after application of the buffer, the results were interpreted. The control line was expected to appear in all tests. If a red band appeared at the test line, the specimen contained FeLV antigen.",
    "To confirm FeLV infection, viral DNA was isolated from the cat blood samples using Genomic DNA preparation kit (Qiagen) and PCR was performed with a commercially available FeLV Detection Kit (GeNet Bio, Korea). The kit is designed to amplify conserved fragment of the FeLV U3 long terminal repeat [16] . Total genomic DNA was directly extracted from the blood specimens using a Genomic DNA preparation kit (Qiagen). Target DNA was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR with three steps at 94 o C for 1 min for denaturation, 50 o C for 1 min for annealing, and 72 o C for 2 min for elongation. Finally, a further elongation step (72 o C for 5 min) was performed. The 166 bp fragment of amplified gene product was analyzed with 2% agarose gel electrophoresis."

    "Albeit a widespread zoonosis, even in Westernized countries [2] , toxocariasis remains a neglected disease [19] , and this report demonstrates that numerous questions surrounding its pathophysiology and clinical manifestations remain.",
    "Human toxocariasis is generally a benign, self-curing disease, and neurologic involvement is quite exceptional. In this study, we report a case of toxocariasis caused by ingestion of an unusual transport host, namely live slugs. The clinical picture comprised eosinophilic lung involvement with severe neurologic disorders in relation to vasculitis as well as retinal detachment.",
    "Central nervous system involvement in toxocariasis is uncommon, with less than 60 cases reported in the English literature [7, 8] . In this series of publications, cerebral vasculitis was a rarity that was only observed in 5 patients (review by Lompo et al [17] ). Intense release of cationic proteins from activated eosinophil cells could be cited as a possible cause of this phenomenon, which is also reported in neuroschistosomiasis [18] . The protein content of eosinophil granules is toxic to endothelial cells and muscle cells, particularly in the heart. According to this hypothesis, this 3-week, high-dosage treatment with corticosteroids certainly avoided further major sequelae in our patient. Ocular involvement, which included retinal detachment and peripheral granuloma in this case, might occur during generalized forms of toxocariasis [6] but was never found to be associated with cerebral vasculitis."

    "In conclusion, the study confirms the presence of D. immitis in domestic and feral cats and that the prevalence was significantly higher in feral cats, especially older feral cats. These results suggest that outdoor exposure time is one of the most important factors for D. immitis infection in cats. Therefore, the present study suggests that prophylaxis against the parasite is advisable to decrease the incidence of feline dirofilariosis in Liaoning Province, northeastern China.",
    "Dirofilaria immitis, the etiologic agent of canine heartworm disease, is commonly found in the pulmonary artery and right ventricle of dogs and other animals. It could infect dogs, cats, and various wild mammals, with increased incidence in temperate and tropical areas [1] . The heartworm parasite is transmitted by various mosquito species, including Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex [2, 3] . After mosquitoes feed on an infected microfilaremic reservoir host, the mosquitoes act as intermediate hosts, carrying infectious \"larvae 3\" (L3) stage larvae, which could be transmitted to a dog or a cat [4] ."

    "Oligonucleotides and PCR reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA), unless otherwise stated. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Electrochemical measurements were performed using a VMP multichannel potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) controlled by EC-Lab software (version 6.70, Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France). The thermal control system for the PCR consisted of a data acquisition card (PCI-MIO-16E-1, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) along with a signal conditioning board (SC-2042-RTD, National Instruments) connected to the temperature sensors. A digital feedback proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm was implemented in LabVIEW software (National Instruments) to control voltage supply to the heater from a power source (HP6629A, Hewlett-Packard, Rockville, MD, USA).",
    "To date, several integrated NA-based analytical systems have been commercialized [http://www.cepheid.com/Sites/ cepheid/content.cfm?id\u00bc158 (GeneXpert from Cepheid), http://www.gen-probe.com/prod_serv/inst_dts.asp (Direct Tube Sampling Systems from Gen-Probe), http://www. idahotech.com/razor/index.html (RAZOR from Idaho Technology) and http://www.iquum.com/products/analyzer. shtml (Liat Analyzer from IQuum)]. Despite their wide use in clinical/central laboratories, their application for on-site pathogen monitoring on a routine basis is still limited due to the large footprint and high instrument cost (mainly the complex optics). A promising alternative would be the inherently simple and lost-cost electrochemical method. Over the past decade, despite a great deal of work having been carried out on electrochemical sequence-specific NA sensing (4) (5) (6) , little work has been undertaken on the integration of these with upstream functionalities. In 2004, Liu et al. (7) successfully demonstrated a fully integrated biochip for cell isolation and lysis, target amplification, as well as electrochemical amplicon detection. One relevant feature of their approach is the incorporation of on-chip mixers, valves, and pumps in a self-contained device. However, the design and fabrication of the chip involves many complicated steps, which limits its practical application."

    "We did observe that peritoneal macrophages from chimeric mice, which express chimeric CEACAM1ba, were resistant to MHV, while chimeric CEACAM1 expressed in cultured cell lines, such as BHK, showed MHV susceptibility, slightly lower than that in cells expressing CEACAM1b. From these findings, it could be postulated that some cellular factor(s) other than CEACAM1 could modify animal susceptibility. This idea appears to be in accordance with findings by Stohlman and Frelinger (1978) , who postulated two factors to determine mouse strain differences in susceptibility to MHV infection. Studies to elucidate such factors are in progress.",
    "The molecule on MHV virion that binds to the receptor is the spike (S) protein with ca. 180-200 kDa class I fusion glycoprotein (Bosch et al., 2003) . One spike is composed of a trimer of the S protein. The S protein of most MHV is cleaved in the middle of the molecule, and the N terminal subunit is called the S1 and C terminal subunits S2, respectively (Sturman et al., 1985) . N terminal 330 amino acids in S1 are responsible for receptor binding (Kubo et al., 1994) , and S2 is critical for envelope-cell membrane fusion, namely, cell entry (Bosch et al., 2003) .",
    "In this review, we report that the receptor of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), is an important determinant of mouse susceptibility to MHV infection. This finding was revealed by using mouse strains with two different allelic forms of the MHV receptor, Ceacam1a and Ceacam1b. Although previous studies indicated that susceptibility is determined by a single gene, Ceacam1, our recent work in gene-replaced mice with chimeric Ceacam1 pointed toward the involvement of other host factors (genes) in the susceptibility. Studies on mouse susceptibility to MHV, as well as the factors involved in their susceptibility, are overviewed."

    "China has the world's second largest tuberculosis (TB) burden after India [1] . Healthcare workers (HCWs) in China's National TB Control Programme have a significantly increased level of exposure to TB disease and patients. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 2003, the Chinese government made increased efforts to protect HCWs from nosocomial TB infections and other respiratory infectious diseases, especially for those HCWs working in chest hospitals and infectious disease hospitals. These efforts (although not universal throughout China) included the increased use of biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories and respiratory isolation through negative pressure wards and rooms, and the practice of standardised biosafety protocols and procedures through continued training and education.",
    "Systematic TB screening in HCWs can improve their awareness of TB infection [2] . The tuberculin skin test (TST) has been widely used for the detection of TB infection for decades but due to cross-reactivity with the bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and exposure to non-TB mycobacteria, the TST fails to provide sufficient specificity for the detection of TB infection [2] . In the past decade, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) release assays have been developed and commercialised to measure the in vitro release of IFN-\u03b3 from effector T-cells stimulated with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target and 10-kDa culture filtrate protein) as an aid to diagnosing TB infection. These new screening assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK)) have demonstrated higher specificity and at least comparable sensitivity for the diagnosis of TB infection compared with the TST [3].",

Towards the goal of TB elimination, prevention and treatment of LTBI are essential elements of global TB control efforts "

In addition, it should be kept in mind that susseccful rechallenge with imatinib coud be another option for a underlying disease after a recovery from interstitial pneumonitis related with imatinib mesylate.",
    "Imatinib mesylate is a targeted therapy that acts by inhibiting tyrosine kinase of the bcr-abl fusion oncoprotein, which is specific to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and the c-transmembrane receptor, which is specific to gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare adverse event of imatinib therapy. It is clinically difficult to distinguish from infectious pneumonia, which can frequently occur due to the underlying disease. The standard treatment for imatinib-induced pneumonitis is to discontinue the medication and optionally administer corticosteroids. However, there are a few cases of successful retrial with imatinib. We describe a case of successful rechallenge of imatinib in a patient with imatinib-induced interstitial pneumonitis and CML without a recurrence of the underlying disease after 3 months of follow-up."

    "Quaternary prevention should be implemented to minimize harm to patients because the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and promote health. Primary care physicians have a major responsibility in quaternary prevention, and the establishment of clinical epidemiology as a distinct field of study would create a role charged with minimizing patient harm arising from over-medicalization.",
    "Medicine's ultimate aim is to prevent disease and to promote health. The framework of primary-secondary-tertiary prevention that was proposed by Leavell and Clark [1] in the 1940s has been widely used to assign roles to healthcare workers in charge of various strategies to attain this goal (Table 1). In the healthcare service system of the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea), public health workers are in charge of primary prevention, that is, preventing the occurrence of diseases, while primary care physicians are in charge of secondary prevention through the early detection of diseases that have occurred, and medical specialists are responsible for tertiary prevention through appropriate treatment that is designed to prevent mortality and enable the patient to return pISSN 1975 -8375 eISSN 2233 to the community.",
    "The domain requiring quaternary prevention faces some risk for ethically unacceptable healthcare practices such as over-medicalization or over-diagnosis [4] . The over-diagnosis of screening in thyroid cancer is one example [5] . Therefore, the goal of quaternary prevention is to protect the safety of patients by preventing avoidable harm under a 'Do No Harm' ethical code [6] . As quaternary prevention means protecting consumers who require healthcare services from unexpected harm, safely protecting consumers from MERS who visited a medical facility for various healthcare service needs would fall under quaternary prevention. If the medical institutions in which the super-spreaders were hospitalized had understood quaternary prevention and had taken appropriate measures, no public health crisis would have emerged. In other words, a multi-faceted surveillance system should be implemented immediately to identify patients at risk of infection and to protect them from avoidable harm."

The pathogenic and highly destructive viruses such as influenza, dengue fever, yellow fever, HIV, and hepatitis C viruses (HCVs) affect the health of hundreds of millions people worldwide every year. By contrast, opportunistic viruses can benefit the host, and this virus mutualism is evolutionarily old. An impressive example of this mutualism is the rosy apple aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea-a major pest of apple trees-which is infected by a densovirus that induces wing development in the aphid. This morphotype is important in enabling aphids to move to new plants (Ryabov et al., 2009; Roossinck and Baz\u00e1n, 2017) ."

However, she did not get a satisfactory answer from the board; instead, she was dismissed from her position. She then wrote to the local professional supervisory office, but here too failed to get a satisfactory response. Next, she decided to turn to the judiciary. However, relevant regulations allow only patients and their families to sue a hospital for malpractice. 79 It thus became difficult for Dr. Chen to hold relevant duty-bearers to account. As a last resort, she decided to pretend to be a patient in order to expose the truth. Although she was a healthy person, the hospital still accepted her as a patient, immediately providing her with illegal treatment. Through her undercover action, Dr. Chen was finally able to collect evidence and file the case before a court. 80 Later, the media reported her story, which pressured the Shanghai Medicine Administration Office into initiating a special investigation on illegal treatments in all hospitals in Shanghai.",

    "Oligonucleotides used in PCR reactions were generally synthesized with BamHI flanking sequences to facilitate easy cloning into plasmid vectors for sequencing. Oligonucleotides were used at I mM in PCR reactions. PCR products were ethanol precipitated, digested with BamHI, and cloned into the pBS plasmid (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA) for sequencing. DNA sequencing was carried out using the dideoxy chain termination method and T7 polymerase (Tabor and Richardson, 1987) . Plasmid derivafives were digested with the appropriate enzymes to generate the correct 5' and 3' ends for cloning and construction of CD8 and CD4 eDNA chimeras.",
    "It is likely that other proteins on the exocytic pathway have both retention and retrieval signals. The sum of the two processes acting on these signals would determine the amount of protein found in a particular compartment. For resident proteins which should spend as much of their time as possible in a particular compartment one would expect retention rather than retrieval to be the dominant process. For recycling proteins, such as receptors, one would expect the opposite so that substantial amounts of protein would be moving between two compartments. It is not yet clear whether TGN38 is best considered as a resident or a recycling protein (Luzio and Banting, 1993; Stanley and Howell, 1993) . That will have to await discovery of its function."

It is strongly suggested that different levels of health settings must strengthen their own optimal infection control requirements, such as negative-pressure wards and qualified laboratories for assaying the potential contaminated clinical specimens, especially in tertiary hospitals, also different levels of health care staffs nationwide must be trained well to MERS surveillance and alertness.",

Social phenomena such as \"doctor shopping\" and \"family nursing\" are more common in Chinese health settings. Larger hospitals are believed to have better doctors. Patients would rather take a long time waiting in either clinic or the emergency rooms until a bed is available than going to community hospital. Those situations could generate a large herd of close contacts and hospital-acquired infection. In addition to that, the spread of the MERS-CoV would become a much more serious status than people could ever imagine since China has a larger and higher density of population, a more rapid mobility of population, and a more aging population than South Korea, such a great fortune for China."

Since first reported in swine in the U.S.A. in February 2014, PDCoV rapidly spread to other states in the U.S.A., as well as to Canada, and it caused significant economic losses in the swine industry [14, 16, [19] [20] [21] . Recently, PDCoV has been reported in the pig population from China and South Korea [5, 12] . Hu et al. reported the cell culture isolation, serial propagation, and biologic and genetic characterizations of cell-adapted PDCoV strains [9] . Jung et al. reported that two PDCoV strains, OH-FD22 and OH-FD100, are enteropathogenic in gnotobiotic pigs [10] . Chen et al. revealed the pathogenicity of a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate and characterized PDCoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets [3] . The accumulating reports demonstrated that PDCoV is associated with diarrhea in pigs."

    "Singapore, by and large, has seen extraordinary growth in its average national income since its humble beginnings as a colonial outpost. In attaining its vision to become a \"distinctive global city\" [31] , its relatively affluent, well-educated, and upwardly mobile population have increased access to environments, goods, and services that are not previously experienced and their risks to individual health uncertain. Besides unusual outbreaks [32, 33] and stress-related disorders [34] , other curious aetiologies [35, 36] have occurred from time to time. In addition, changes in lifestyle by an ageing population-about 400 000 baby boomers will turn 65 years old between now and 2020-is a major force re-shaping our society.",
    "For outbreak management, investment needs to be wisely directed towards capability enhancement and Singapore has learnt that dealing with unknowns requires sufficient bandwidth in both infrastructure (i.e., hardware) and expertise (i.e., software). Recognising the importance of epidemic intelligence, a public health intelligence unit was set up in 2011 to monitor and analyse changes in local and overseas disease landscapes. Intelligence that is acquired from this process is used to track potential threats, trigger public health response, and facilitate risk communication to relevant stakeholders as necessary.",
    "Fear and uncertainty over an unknown disease could ignite widespread panic, with adverse repercussions on the economy and social fabric. Hence, in the aftermath of SARS, Singapore invested heavily into pandemic preparedness [14, 15] . Our national strategy is premised on a well established surveillance and response system that forewarns, detects, and contains the importation of a novel agent, and on mitigation measures when community spread is sustained (i.e., showing no epidemiological link to imported source cases). A national pandemic readiness and response plan was developed with the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition framework as its risk management centre-piece [16] . This framework helps calibrate outbreak response according to the nature and transmissibility of the agent.",
    "Similarly, the widespread dissemination of the novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 was thought to be related to the high number of flights out of early major centres of the epidemic. Investigations into a cluster of six cases confirmed transmission of the H1N1 on board a commercial aircraft [11] . These events illustrate the capability of diseases to transmit rapidly across borders, facilitated by convenient air travel [12, 13] .",
    "Singapore's international connectivity places it at an increased risk of disease outbreaks, with global air travel playing a pivotal role in the dissemination of emerging infections. In February 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced into Singapore with the return of three unsuspecting young travellers from Hong Kong [5] . SARS transmission from symptomatic patients to other passengers and crew was subsequently documented in at least three flights flying outbound from Hong Kong [5] ."

    "a The circulating strain in bold type indicates its antigenic property is significantly different from that of the contemporary global vaccine strain of the same subtype. strains were also shared with the WHO Collaborating Centers in the United States (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and Japan ( Japan National Institute of Infectious Diseases).",
    "On May 20, this unsubtyped influenza virus strain was sent to TCDC. After results of H1, H3, H5, H7, and H9 molecular diagnoses were all negative, the virus was further identified as the H6N1 subtype based on sequence analysis of its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Subsequently, TCDC developed the molecular diagnostic method and conducted enhanced active surveillance. From June 10 to August 13, a total of 125 individuals with influenzalike illness or pneumonia were reported; all of their respiratory specimens tested negative for H6N1. Six symptomatic contacts were identified, and serological analyses of the paired serum specimens collected from those contacts also showed undetectable antibody titers (&10) against the H6N1 virus, while titers of the first and second serum specimens of the index case were 40 and 80, respectively. 26 Therefore, no additional H6N1-infected cases were identified.",
    "To evaluate possible risks of the novel H7N9 viruses to public health, viral genetic markers that may be related to human adaptation and their antigenic properties were analyzed by TCDC. All 4 H7N9 viruses are antigenically similar to the A/Anhui/1/2013 vaccine candidate strain. However, they harbor markers related to enhanced polymerase activity (the 627K or 701N in the polymerase basic protein 2) and high-affinity binding of virus to human receptors (the 226L in the hemagglutinin protein), suggesting their better replication and infection capabilities in human population. 25 One virus also has markers that may confer oseltamivir resistance (the 292K in the neuraminidase protein). Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship of viral full-genome sequences reveals that these 4 viruses were generated through various reassortment events in China, indicating their complex evolutionary history. 25 These findings are consistent with the initial viral characteristics reported by other research groups at the early stage of H7N9 outbreaks in China. 31 ",
    "Identification of the first global human infection with the influenza A(H6N1) virus in 2013 in Taiwan highlights the important role of the national influenza laboratory surveillance network. 26 Avian influenza A(H6N1) virus is a common virus isolated from migrating birds and domestic poultry in many countries. 32, 33 However, human infection with this subtype had not been reported prior to the confirmation of H6N1 infection in a 20-year-old patient with influenzalike illness by TCDC in May 2013. On May 8, 2013 , an influenza A virus isolated from the inpatient's throat swab specimen was identified by a regional authorized laboratory using an immunofluorescence assay. However, subsequent analyses by subtype-specific PCR assays showed negative results for human H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses."

All households reported in the follow-up call that they had obtained the sample, and we received 29 samples (96.7%) (most samples [n=28] by mail, and one specimen brought directly to the laboratory). Of those who mailed the specimen, most (78.6%) reported mailing it within 1 day; all reported mailing it within 2 days.

Using nasal self-swabbing to obtain samples for laboratory analysis has advantages during outbreaks or pandemics, as this strategy would reduce the time required for health care professionals to obtain specimens, as well as lessen their risk of becoming infected. Furthermore, self-swabbing could be used to identify ARI/ILI etiologies in the community that might be missed from reliance on medically-attended disease surveillance."

    "Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare Complex (MAIC) is a common pathogen that, like M. tuberculosis, causes tuberculosis in humans and opportunistic infections in those suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [7, 15, 30] . Mycobacteriosis in swine caused by MAIC is a chronic infectious disease, which presents as caseous necrosis in submandibular lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes. In swine, the most common lesion is the one found in mesenteric lymph node [32] . Mycobacteriosis is the only known disease that forms caseous necrosis in animals and humans. Japanese meat inspection service follows the statements of a manual [20] : 'a caseous necrosis suggests mycobacteriosis', and it regards such case as mycobacteriosis without further microbiological examinations. Intestines are condemned when the caseous necrosis is a single lesion, and whole carcasses are condemned when the systemic infection is found, causing a significant economic burden for the pig producer."

    "It is of particular interest that BAG3 deficiency can result in the loss of hematopoietic stem cells due to a defect in stem cell niche. 61 Therefore, BAG3 is required for the stem cellsupporting activity of microenvironmental cells. This finding suggests that BAG3 may also regulate the cancer stem cell-supporting activity of stromal cells in the hematopoietic and possibly in other compartments. Again, NF-kB factors could represent key targets of BAG3, not only for the expression of tumor cell genes that sustain cell survival, but also for the expression of stromal cells' soluble and cell surface molecules that mediate bidirectional interactions between tumor cells and their environment. 77, 78 ",
    "From the first evidence of BAG3-mediated survival in B-CLLs, 21 a number of reports confirmed the anti-apoptotic activity of the protein in tumors of the hematopoietic 2, 13, 21, 22, 25, 28, 30, 39, 40, 49 and other 2, 20, 24, 25, 29, 31, 34, 36, 37, 44 compartments. Two principal elements contribute to the role of BAG3 in vast range of tumors: bag3 induction by HSF1, 47 a transcription factor activated in many cancer types; 46 and BAG3 ability to sustain of NF-kB activity. 76 In addition, BAG3, because of its multifaceted ability to complex with many proteins, can regulate factors that are particularly relevant in the context of specific tumor types, such as BAX in glioblastoma cells. 36 Overall, studies on BAG3 expression and activity in normal and neoplastic cells, and of its regulation during the development, increasingly delineate a complex picture of BAG3 involvement in physiological and pathological processes. The pleiotropic functions attributed to BAG3 probably reflect the adapter nature of this multidomain (BAG, WW and PXXP) protein and its ability to assemble scaffolding complexes, which participate in more than one signal transduction pathway.",
    "It has been shown that bag3 silencing reduces adhesion and/or motility of epithelial (breast, prostate) tumor cells. 27, 32, 65, 66 In MDA435 human breast cancer cells, BAG3 overexpression resulted in a decrease in migration and adhesion to matrix molecules; the decrease was reversed on deletion of the BAG3 proline-rich (PXXP) domain, indicating that an interaction of BAG3 with a SH 3 domain-containing protein was involved. 65 Expression array studies showed that indeed BAG3 regulated, in a PXXP-dependent manner, the expression of CCN (Cyr61, connective tissue growth, NOV) 1, a matricellular signaling protein that promotes cell adhesion through integrins and heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans. 32 In addition, BAG3 seems to regulate cell adhesion through binding to guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2 (PDZGEF2). This protein induces the activation of Rap1, a regulator of cell-cell junction formation and remodeling, and increases integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The PPDY motif at the C-terminus of PDZGEF2 was shown to bind to the WW domain of BAG3, and PDZGEF2 knockdown reduced BAG3 ability to induce cell adhesion in Cos7 cells. 67 Similarly to what we described above for apoptosis, the ability of BAG3 to regulate cell adhesion appears to rely on multiple interactions of this protein through different structural domains. It is important to note that modulation of cell adhesion has profound effects on cell vitality, as cell detachment from matrix induces the apoptotic process known as anoikis. 68 Therefore, BAG3 alterations could underlie effects on both cell detachment/motility and resistance to associated anoikis, thereby favouring metastatization. Finally, we recently reported that BAG3, through its interaction with the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin containing TCP-1), regulates actin folding. 66 This property of BAG3 highlights its involvement in cytoskeleton organization, possibly influencing not only cell survival and migration, but also membrane trafficking and organellar dynamics."

These proteins are of critical importance because of their organ-specific, spatio-temporal regulatory ability.

    "The distinction between cancer initiation and progression has grown more pronounced with the discovery of signaling pathways specific to each process. Progression of cancer from early to late stage is a critical step after which therapeutic intervention becomes increasingly difficult. At a cellular level, progression often involves gaining resistance to therapeutic agents and assumption of a less differentiated state. These characteristics can result in metastatic disease. Recent studies propose that the loss of NMI enhances the cellular acquisition of these characteristics that ultimately lead to cancer progression (Fig. 3) ."

    "As the patient presented with diarrhea and he had few respiratory symptoms, he did not meet the case definition of MERS when he arrived at the airport, 16 and the quarantine officer did not isolate him. This raised a question whether the case definition should be revised to include diarrhea symptom. The answer depends on whether MERS-CoV is excreted into stool and transmissible to others, however, no fecal transmission has been reported so far. Moreover, as diarrhea is a common and non-specific symptom, many patients with traveler's diarrhea without MERS-CoV infection would undergo unnecessary screening tests. Therefore, inclusion of diarrhea symptom in the case definition for MERS-CoV surveillance requires more data and ensuring evidence."

    "The current outbreak of EHF highlighted the importance of prevention strategies. Health care workers have represented a considerable proportion of all infected cases. So educating and training the medical staff on universal precautions, risk assessment, and use of personal protective equipment is crucial. Patients initially identified as having a possible viral hemorrhagic fever should be isolated until the results of their specific diagnosis are obtained from reference laboratories. It is important not to delay diagnosis and treatment of more common diseases, such as malaria or typhoid, during this period. Follow-up of contact cases is essential for infection containment in case the patient tests are positive. Specially equipped ambulances and trained staff should be prepared to do the transferring when needed (1, 10, 24) . Early diagnosis and rapid laboratory confirmation along with isolation of patients and following their contacts, as well as access to protective equipment and environmental decontamination are the mainstay of prevention.",
    "Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) was first reported in 1976 with two concurrent outbreaks of acute viral hemorrhagic fever centered in Yambuku (near the Ebola river), Democratic Republic of Congo, and in Nzara, Sudan. The current outbreak of the Ebola virus was started by reporting the first case in March 2014 in the forest regions of southeastern Guinea. Due to infection rates raising over 13,000% within a 6-month period, Ebola is now considered as a global public health emergency and on August 8 th , 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. With more than 5000 involved cases and nearly 3000 deaths, this event has turned into the largest and most dangerous Ebola virus outbreak in the world. Based on the above-mentioned, the present article aimed to review the virologic characteristics, transmission, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Ebola virus disease.",
    "There is no specific antiviral agent or vaccine against Ebola viruses. Therefore, supportive care is the most important aspect of its management. Aggressive prevention of intravascular volume depletion is critical to avoid life-threatening complications by using proper fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, correcting profound electrolyte abnormalities, and preventing the complications of shock such as acid-base derangements. Treatment of other infections, if they occur, and close monitoring of vital signs and regular biochemical and blood gas checks should be done. These proceedings are considered as the foundation of critical care medicine and should be applied to both resource-rich and resource-constrained settings. With improving supportive cares, EHF outcomes may also improve. Symptom control with taking narcotics and benzodiazepines were often reported as the end-of-life therapy in some patients (2, 5, 14) . A variety of chemotherapeutic agents have been tested for different stages of development. Recombinant human activated protein C and recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein C2 are also among them. One drug identified as ZMAPP, has been used on several patients, however it remains unclear if it is effective or not. Therefore, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved agent exists against Ebola (4, 6, (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Figure 1 shows the latest CDC algorithm regarding emergency department evaluation and management for possible Ebola infected patients."

Endocytosis and recycling of the TfK with either its ligand or anti-TfK mAbs have been extensively analyzed in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells (30) (31) (32) (33) . In agreement with these findings, we found that OKT9 does not inhibit Tfbinding to its receptors, but downregulates surface Till on T cells when incubated at 37~ This is followed by a decrease of iodinated Tf and HBenvAg bindings, confirming that this mAb blocked HBenvAg presentation by interfering with its internalization (data not shown)."

Serum samples from 13 volunteers with no CCHFV infection history were used as a negative control panel. The plant-produced NP detected anti-CCHFV IgG in all positive serum samples, while all negative serum samples gave results below the cut-off value.

    "Objetivo: Exploramos los patrones de prescripci\u00f3n de los m\u00e9dicos en Trinidad Norte para el tratamiento de infecciones del tracto superior respiratorio (URTI) en pacientes pedi\u00e1tricos y la adecuaci\u00f3n de los medicamentos prescritos. M\u00e9todos: Se realiz\u00f3 un estudio observacional retrospectivo, con un tama\u00f1o de muestra de 523 pacientes pedi\u00e1tricos diagnosticados con una URTI entre junio 2003 y 22 junio de 2005. Este estudio fue realizado en 5 centros de atenci\u00f3n primaria en Trinidad Norte. Resultados: Las 3 URTI m\u00e1s frecuentemente diagnosticadas fueron, por orden, URTI no espec\u00edficas, resfriado com\u00fan, y amigdalitis aguda. Se identificaron 4 patrones de prescripci\u00f3n, (1) sin tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico [ [29,1%] ; y gotas de suero salino normal [14,2%] . En 112 casos con an\u00e1lisis de torundas, de los que el 98,2% revel\u00f3 crecimiento de comensales, mientras que en el 1,8% crecieron microorganismos pat\u00f3genos. De los casos que mostraron crecimiento de comensales s\u00f3lo, se trataron con antibi\u00f3tico el 84,6%, con agentes sintom\u00e1ticos solos el 14,5% y el 0,9% no recibi\u00f3 tratamiento alguno. Conclusiones: A una gran proporci\u00f3n de pacientes pedi\u00e1tricos diagnosticados con una URTI en Trinidad Norte se le prescribi\u00f3 antibi\u00f3ticos aunque no estaban indicados. El uso inadecuado de antibi\u00f3ticos puede potenciar la tendencia mundial hacia las resistencias antimicrobianas."

NO is also a well known biological mediator in the host response to infection (16, 17) . Various inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and cytokines including IFNg and TNF can cause high and sustained NO production by iNOS; depending on the species, strain, infection dose and pathogen entry route, iNOS activity can result in proor anti-inflammatory responses, cytotoxicity, or cytoprotection [reviewed in (16) ].",

Several published studies have shown an association between acute bronchiolitis and secondary bacterial infection, including urinary tract infections (UTI). However, the proposed mechanism by which a virus can induce UTIs is not yet known. The aim of this commentary is to update the current evidence of risk of UTI in children with bronchiolitis. We present several clinical studies related to the topic as well as a brief review of the potential pathophysiology of secondary infections that could present with viral respiratory illness.",
    "In a review of the literature, the percentage of patients with fever with positive urine cultures ranged from 4.2% to 20.0% in infants <3 months of age and 0% to 7.4% in older children (3 to 36 months of age). 14 Ralston et al 3 conducted a systematic review delineating the risk of occult SBI in young febrile infants presenting with either \"clinical bronchiolitis\" or \"proven RSV infection\". The review included 11 studies. [4] [5] [6] [7] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 15, 16 The rate of urinary tract infections in the 11 studies analyzed was 3.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.9-5.7%). The authors concluded the rate of urine cultures positive for bacteria was noteworthy, though asymptomatic bacteriuria may have muddled the results. Recently, McDaniel et al 17 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the prevalence of UTI in infants and young children with bronchiolitis when positive urinalysis (UA) results being incorporated into the UTI definition. The investigators included 18 studies, [4] [5] [6] [7] 9, [11] [12] [13] 15, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] seven of which had UA information. 4, 11, 16, 18, [20] [21] [22] The definition of positive UA varied among the studies. Some considered positive UA as having more than 5 white blood cells per high-powered field, while others considered the UA positive by having bacteriuria, positive leukocyte esterase, or positive nitrite. The prevalence of UTI in bronchiolitis in the 18 studies was 3.1% (95% CI, 1.8-4.6%). The authors further analyzed the data of the 7 studies where the presence of pyuria or nitrites was a diagnostic criterion to define UTI and the prevalence of UTI was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.3-1.4%)."

    "The potential role of climate change in triggering Ebola viral disease outbreaks and other emerging diseases",
    "In a bid to overcoming some diagnostic bottlenecks, Formenty and colleagues, demonstrated that oral fluids can be used to detect Ebola virus during outbreaks. 64 The findings were based on 24 patients and 10 controls during an outbreak in DRC in 2003 and clearly, this non-invasive procedure could be useful during outbreaks for several reasons. The procedure may be more acceptable culturally in settings where communities view blood as sacred. It will eliminate the risk of needle injuries and will not require cold chain and rapid transportation and above all, it may be cheaper and safer to conduct compared to blood tests. But despite these advantages, the technique has not received sufficient research attention.",
    "Bio-security threat of EVD is arguably the most challenging global health problem at the moment. This threat is amplified by the magnitude, longevity and non-availability of drugs or vaccines against the disease. Sadly, containment measures are expensive and unsustainable in resource-poor settings with lean health budgets. The rising GDP in West Africa enhanced by transport technology (including aviation) in increasingly inter-connected world further amplifies the threat of global spread.",
    "The authors reviewed mainly 5 online data-bases and a hand search of the reference list of key articles. We reviewed 51 articles that were relevant up until the end date of the search on August 18, 2016 We limited article searches to those published in either English or French, as those were the ones we had resources to translate. We included not only articles but also editorials and letters. We excluded articles on Ebola cases outside Africa. In Table 2 there is a summary of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.",
    "In several rural settings in SSA, there is a wide array of cultural beliefs and practices that do not promote good health. Many cultures do not belief in the germ theory of infectious disease, instead, they ascribe illnesses to supernatural causes-evil forces, or work of enemies, including sorcery and witchcraft. 58, 59 Depending on the view, different communities have different cultural practices to address a particular disease. These include the institution of certain taboos, which restrict people from seeking care from health facilities, ritualistic practices to appease the gods and get rid of evil forces, or the use of charms, scarifications, amulets or oral portions to prevent illnesses caused by enemies. 60 As a result of these beliefs, health care is generally first sought from spiritual or traditional healers. A visit to a health facility only occurs as a last resort, if the illness does not resolve. 61 Even when rural people decide to visit a facility, their choices are often guided by many factors, including familiarity with the providers-people from their community, who speak their language, are known to them and treat them with respect.",
    "Effective interruption of intensive transmission of Ebolavirus requires the application of three public principles namely, isolation of cases, provision of supportive treatment and contact tracing and monitoring of suspected cases. As illustrated in Table 1 , none of the crises or countries at-risk of EVD has the capacity to deal with EVD. These health system factors can severely compromise a nation's capacity to respond appropriately to an EBV outbreak in several ways as discussed below."

    "All mqPCR assays detected only the target pathogen and did not produce any non-specific amplification products or products of other pathogens in repeated experiments. In addition, there were no false positives due to cross-talk between dye signals within each reaction. Standard curves for all multiplex assays generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of each template showed correlation coefficients (R 2 ) ranging from 0.970 to 0.995 and slopes of 3.41-3.59 (Fig. 1) , indicating good linearity of PCR amplification.",
    "Meningoencephalitis (ME) results from concurrent inflammation of the meninges (meningitis) and brain (encephalitis) [22] . ME can be classified as granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, or necrotizing leukoencephalitis based on histopathologic features [28] . However, in veterinary practice, this classification is challenging because it requires biopsy and histopathologic examination. Thus, a simple and rapid strategy for identifying the causative agent of ME would be useful for selecting an appropriate therapeutic regimen.",
    "Lyme disease is a zoonotic tick-borne disease caused by B. burgdorferi that affects various organs in dogs, including the skin, lymph nodes, aorta, and kidney [4, 9] . Although the bacterium also infects the meninges and choroid plexus, CNS involvement is not pathognomonic of Lyme disease [18] . In the present study, two cases positive for B. burgdorferi had a history of ixodid tick infestation. In both cases, the locations of CNS lesions included the choroid plexus, which can be associated with neurologic signs in dogs afflicted by neuroborreliosis. However, it was not possible to confirm whether the lesions were caused by B. burgdorferi because the owners declined additional tests and therapeutic trials."

DNA dendrimers are layer-by-layer selfassembled functional branched DNA units (eg, Y-shaped building blocks) made through predesigned base-pairing hybridization. These somewhat bulkier DNs form promising scaffolds for versatile biomedical applications ( Figure 6 ).

COPD differs from asthma in that the main characteristic is irreversible airflow obstruction (49, 50) . The physiological abnormalities that characterize COPD are emphysema and obliteration of small airways (50) . Although emphysema can occur independently of small airway narrowing, and vice versa, these 2 pathologies usually coexist in COPD (50) . Narrowing of the small airways is caused by inflammation, increased airway muscle mass and fibrosis in the airway wall, and accumulation of inflammatory mucus exudates in the lumen (50) .",

    "Although the major inflammatory cells involved in COPD are CD8 + T cells, neutrophils and macrophages, some patients have eosinophil involvement (similar to that in asthma) (47) . As mentioned before, eosinophils migrate in response to cytokines (IL-5 in particular) and specific chemokines (such as eotaxin I and RANTES). Exacerbation of COPD is triggered by persistent inflammation, which is itself caused by eosinophil-derived proinflammatory mediators such as basic proteins, cytokines, and growth factors (51) ."

    "Identification of the SUKH superfamily and associated nucleic acid modifying toxin systems has considerable implications for understanding bacterial genetic conflicts, evolutionary forces acting on strongly linked multi-gene loci, and potential biotechnological applications. We briefly discuss some of these implications that emerge directly from our observations.",
    "The third major linkage we observed was between SUKH superfamily genes and those encoding gigantic bacterial surface proteins with repetitive motifs such as the hemagglutinin-repeats, RHS repeats (YD) and another previously uncharacterized a-helical repeat motif. All these proteins showed a characteristic feature of possessing a highly variable but globular domain at the extreme C-terminus of the protein, downstream of the repetitive region. These proteins also usually contain 'h' in red, a-helix). The numbers in bracket are indicative of the excluded residues from sequences. 'hash' indicates the residues involved in metal ion-binding, 'percent' symbol indicates the conserved histidine which is required for activation of the water molecule for hydrolysis and 'asterisk' indicates the conserved asparagines. On the right, structures of HNH and EndoG families are shown as cartoon representations with the central structural core colored by structural element type (a-helices in purple, b-sheets in yellow), and key catalytic residues highlighted. For those newly identified families, inferred topology diagrams of their core nuclease domains are shown with conserved catalytic residues.",
    "The current study points to the remarkable flexibility of SUKH domains in mediating different protein-protein interactions. In a sense, this situation resembles what has earlier been observed with certain scaffolds like the immunoglobulin domain and the leucine-rich repeats of various immunity-related proteins of eukaryotes (98, 99) . The ability of the SUKH scaffold to accommodate diverse binding partners makes it a potential candidate as a template for protein engineering to generate novel binding capabilities. Likewise, the C-terminal diversification of the toxin domain could also have biotechnological utility as a model for generating secreted proteins that differ extensively in a given module but retain a constant N-terminal part. We hope that this characterization of the SUKH superfamily and identification of the associated nuclease toxin families provides new leads for the future exploration of the manifold implications of the systems discussed here."

Subsequently, 22 EVD outbreaks were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa [2] . These outbreaks generally occurred in relatively remote areas, were contained by quarantine measures, and caused a maximum of 425 cases per outbreak (during the 2000-2001 EVD outbreak in Uganda). The ongoing EVD epidemic, which originated in Guinea [3] , differs markedly from previous outbreaks: it affects Western Africa and is associated with a higher death toll than all previously recorded outbreaks jointly [4] . The massive scale of the epidemic is likely due to the delayed public health response. However, the currently circulating viruses harbor >30 unique amino acid substitutions [5] , and it is currently unclear whether these mutations allow for more-efficient spread in and between humans, compared with viruses responsible for past outbreaks."

Abbreviations used in this paper: Endo H, endoglucosaminidase H; N-CAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; NGF, nerve growth factor. is indirect, since modification of cell surface carbohydrate is difficult. For example, enzymatic treatment to remove carbohydrate residues is often incomplete and selective for certain proteins. The use of tunicamycin as an inhibitor of protein glycosylation yields results that often are difficult to interpret, because protein synthesis may be affected by long exposure to tunicamycin and because proteins completely lacking N-linked carbohydrate may accumulate at intracellular sites and not reach the cell surface (Elbein, 1984; Olden et al., 1985) .",

    "Although there is only one pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus, for which a mAb is licensed for use, there are a number of other infectious disease indications-such as Ebola virus disease treatment and human immunodeficiency virus primary and secondary prevention-for which mAbs are being tested in advanced phase clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Despite all of these advantages, the timelines and costs of mAb research and development (R&D) are respectively longer and higher than that for polyclonal antibody preparations.",
    "As the life cycle and genetic sequence of this new coronavirus has become better elucidated, the rational design and development of novel and approved agents with potent antiviral activity have become possible. The advent of high-throughput screens of licensed compounds and small molecules has also allowed researchers to efficiently evaluate large libraries of drugs for their in vitro antiviral activity against novel targets [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] . To date, several dozen licensed drugs have been reported to inhibit MERS-CoV replication. Using slightly different screening technologies, different groups have converged on some common classes of compounds, including nucleoside analogues, antibacterial protein synthesis inhibitors, kinase signalling modifiers, antimetabolites and antiprotozoal agents.",
    "Despite intensive efforts to develop a MERS-CoV vaccine, the prevalence and transmissibility of this emerging pathogen are both relatively low [3, 26] , making it difficult to define a target population for vaccination. mAbs, on the other hand, can be administered in the setting of an outbreak without the need to discriminate who might be at greatest risk for infection. They can be used to treat cases early in their natural history and for post-exposure prophylaxis of case contacts. mAbs also carry the benefits of higher potency, greater specificity, more extensive pre-licensing evaluation and consequently a more vetted safety profile. Additionally, mAbs can help define immunogenic epitopes through crystallographic analysis, thereby providing atomic-level detail for the design of better immunogens. They also have been proven as effective therapies in the areas of cancer treatment and autoimmune disease management."

The similarity of the R1/R2 fragment of A. testudinarium to that of H. longicornis was 96.2% (457/475).

In Japan, tick-borne encephalitis [29] , Lyme disease [17] , Japanese spotted fever [21] and other tick-borne diseases have been classically reported. Additionally, some cases of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), whose etiological agents were potentially transmitted by ticks, were reported in early 2013 in the western region of Japan [28] . Ticks might also harbor unknown pathogens that could cause emerging infections in animals and humans. Therefore, it is important to study tick ecology and to survey the vector-borne pathogens in ticks.",
    "Genus Rickettsia consists of obligate intracellular, gram negative bacteria. The tick has been identified as the vector of these pathogens. The spotted fever group of rickettsiae is the causative agents of rickettsiosis manifested by rash, fever, headache and eschars. In Japan, over 100 patients with Japanese spotted fever caused by Rickettsia japonica are reported every year [23, 24] . The increasing distribution of the disease has raised concerns for public health. Therefore, the prevalence of ticks on the plants and wild boars and their harboring rickettsia were investigated in Kyoto city, Japan."

    "Viruses in the genus Betacoronavirus include pathogens that cause emerging pandemic diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), in humans. It has been suggested that bats are major reservoirs for these zoonotic pathogens [9] . This justifies surveillance for coronaviruses (CoVs) in bats throughout the world. In Japan, CoVs belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus have been detected in intestinal and fecal specimens of Eastern bent-winged bats (Miniopterus fuliginosus) in Wakayama Prefecture [8] . Here, we report the first demonstration of group B betacoronaviruses in little Japanese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus cornutus) in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.",
    "We report group B Betacoronavirus infection in little Japanese horseshoe bats in Iwate prefecture. We then used reversetranscription PCR to look for the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene in fecal samples collected from 27 little Japanese horseshoe bats and found eight were provisionally positive. We had a success in the nucleotide sequencing of six of the eight positive samples and compared them with those of authentic coronaviruses. We found that these six samples were positive in coronavirus infection, and they belonged to the group B Betacornavirus by phylogenetic analysis. Virus isolation using the Vero cell culture was unsuccessful. Pathogenic trait of these bat coronaviruses remained unexplored.",
    "Our results indicate that betacoronaviruses closely related to SARS CoV were prevalent among little Japanese horseshoe bats in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. Currently, pathogenic trait of these betacoronaviruses is unknown. Although there is no evidence of human infection by these bat CoVs, the existence of group B betacoronaviruses in bats may be predictive of the emergence of a disease, such as SARS, since the Isari cave is also used as a den for civets, which is another potential intermediate species. During this study, we marked the bats with aluminum bands to identify them for further investigation of their habitat. This may provide further information, so we can achieve a better understanding of the relationship between rhinolophid bat behavior and betacoronavirus ecology in the future."

    "Background A/H1N1, more commonly referred to as swine flu, emerged in Mexico in spring 2009. It rapidly spread across the world and was classed as a global pandemic on 11 June 2009. Objective To analyse UK newsprint coverage of the swine flu pandemic. Methods Content analysis of 2374 newsprint articles published in eight UK national newspapers between 1",
    "Despite predictions, the second peak in cases in the UK as the 'normal' flu season came around failed to exceed the first peak, and as many cases also proved to be mild, swine flu was no longer front page news. Its perceived threat may have reduced as many people experienced swine flu for themselves with few adverse consequences, and the drop-off in reporting may itself have acted to reassure people. However, during this period newspaper reports continued to mention UK deaths, and articles gave greater attention to identifying those at most risk. This coincided with the introduction of the swine flu vaccination programme targeting those at highest risk. However, throughout the period there was little attention paid to vaccine development or vaccine safety, suggesting again that the concerns about vaccine safety which were so prominent in the MMR controversy 12 have not been projected forward onto reporting of newer vaccines.",
    "To develop a coding frame, a random selection of 100 articles were read through to identify the key discourses around A/ H1N1. These discourses became thematic categories in an initial coding frame. Using the principles of grounded theory, further batches of 20 articles were read and coded until no new categories emerged from the newspaper articles. At this point we assessed that we had reached 'saturation' and had identified all the relevant thematic categories. 20 The coding of the articles was carried out over a five-week period by five coders who worked together in close collaboration with the first author, checking and validating each others' coding. The coding framework recorded the publication, date, page, word count, newspaper section, and whether there was any reference to 44 thematic categories. The tone of the headline was also rated, because headlines are used to anchor and encapsulate what the journalist/editor defines as the most newsworthy aspect of the story and its main trajectory. 21 Headlines, and the overall tone of the article, were separately rated as 'alarmist', 'reassuring' or 'neither': 'alarmist' headlines were those that were judged as potentially able to cause the reader anxiety; 'reassuring' headlines were judged to be potentially able to allay the reader's fears. The remaining headlines tended to be factual and use bland language. To test the inter-rater reliability of all aspects of coding, just over 10% (n\u00bc250) of the 2374 articles were double coded by SH independently of the coders. Using Cohen's k coefficient we found an inter-rater agreement of k\u00bc0.62. This corresponds to a substantial level of agreement."

    "In our study, the average age of post-SARS ONFH patients was 29.9 years. Due to more daily activity in young people leading to heavy load on hip joints, hip joint surgery in early stages may encounter the risk of resurgery. Stringent challenge may result in patient's psychological, physiological and economic burden once undergoing surgical failure or complications. Some surgeons thus suggested conserving the femoral heads maximally instead of artificial hip joint replacement. Before making a diagnosis based on imaging evidence showing femoral head collapse, conservation treatment mainly aims to recover the function of the hip joint, to alleviate pain, and to block or retard collapse progression for curing necrosis lesion, thus improving prognosis and reducing surgical risks."

    "This review will focus primarily on influenza and parainfluenza virus infections and discuss recent insights into the course of CD8 + T RM cell establishment in the lung interstitium/ parenchyma and airways, from initial priming, to tissue migration, local differentiation, and maintenance.",
    "It is well established that effector CD8 + T cells recruited to the lung subsequently encounter respiratory DC subsets that present cognate antigen. This ''second hit'' with cognate antigen at the site of infection improves the cell capacity to secrete IFN-c (88) and induces additional rounds of proliferation (87) . In addition to stimulating the CD8 + T cells, respiratory DCs trans-present IL-15 to prevent rapid apoptosis of the cells (89) . While these antigen stimulation processes regulate terminal effector differentiation, several studies have indicated that local antigen recognition also serves as a primary tissue-derived instructive factor requisite for effective T RM differentiation (9, 59, 90, 97, 123, 133) ."

    "The photochemical mechanism of action of riboflavin is mediated by both Type I and Type II redox reactions. Upon activation with UV light, riboflavin oxidizes guanine residues in DNA and RNA via direct electron transfer reactions, which occur in the absence of oxygen. The primary photoproduct of riboflavin under these conditions is lumichrome, though other intermediate metabolic and/or photochemical degradation products have been identified, including formylmethylflavin, 2 0 keto-flavin, and 4 0 keto-flavin. These by-products occur at very low concentrations (44) (Fig. 1) . Riboflavin is able to penetrate the mitochondrial membrane and may facilitate mitochondrial function in its role as a flavin molecule (45) .",
    "Interestingly, Mirasol may also prevent alloimmunization. Studies have shown impaired binding of Mirasol treated leukocytes to responder cells and no antigen presentation after Mirasol treatment or proliferation of responder cells in a mixed leukocyte culture. A possible explanation may be that the Mirasol-treated cells have significantly reduced expression of several surface receptors that are involved in T-cell activation and adhesion, specifically HLA-DR, ICAM 1-3, CD80 and CD86, in addition to inhibition of cell to cell interactions (58) . There was no allo-antibody formation in a rat transfusion model (59), a findingwhich could have significant implications for patient care and general transfusion practices for transplant patients and multiply-transfused individuals.",

Although nasopharyngeal swab sampling is a sensitive and sufficient method for children [129, 130] , this simplest sampling method may be difficult to apply to adults [131] . To obtain a sufficient sample and viral load, optimal sampling probably requires both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sampling.

It should become a valuable tool for anyone working on viral evolution, but also to understand the general mechanisms behind protein evolution and functional innovation.",
    "The major drawback of currently available databases of homologous families to the study of viral homologies and lateral gene transfer in viruses is their taxonomic compartimentalization. Indeed, current databases present families of homologies either restricted to viruses only [Protein Clusters (8) , GeneTree (9) ] or to viral taxonomic groups [Viral Orthologous Cluster (10) ], some also not presenting viral information [HomoloGene (11) ]. The few databases that do present viral and non-viral sequences, such as Pfam (12) or the Conserved Domain Database (13) do not provide complete phylogenetic trees. This translates into the fact that it is not currently possible to have a global view on viral-host lateral gene transfers due to the difficulty of obtaining global information on cross-taxa transfers at the viral level."

The time-dependent evolution of magnetization during the CPMG period was solved numerically by non-linear least squares fitting using in-house Matlab software. Errors in fits were calculated using Jacobian or 200 Monte Carlo simulations (33) , and the larger of the two errors was reported for CPMG and CEST relaxation dispersion analysis."

    "Proficiency in managing an emerging outbreak should not be acknowledged by way of unfortunate experience if the outbreak can be prevented first-hand. Guidelines for human vaccine development encompass principles of cost, efficacy, and safety (8) . Guidelines of animal vaccine development are less stringent (2, 6) . The development of a human HeV vaccine can be time-consuming and prohibitively costly at the current stage. This strategy, however, is much more feasible than the one concerning the containment of an emerging infection \u00c1 clearly evidenced after taking into account the responses to the recent emergence of bat-related zoonotic epidemics such as Ebola and MERS-CoV.",
    "T he Hendra virus (HeV) is an emerging zoonotic infection in Queensland, Australia (1\u00c13). First identified in 1994, it is associated with a human fatality rate of 60% (4) . Traditionally infecting fruit bats, recent host amplification of HeV in infected equines is purported to underlie the spate of fatal outbreaks of HeV infection among exposed humans in Queensland, Australia (5). To prevent further outbreaks, Biosecurity Australia (the chief health surveillance agency in Australia) commissioned the successful and rapid development of an equine vaccine against HeV to preclude the incidence of additional human cases (6) .",
    "Effective initially, the HeV vaccine is slowly losing its efficacy. In 2013 alone, over a span of 6 months, eight equines and a canine died of an HeV infection. In 2014, over a similar time frame, three instances of HeV infection were reported in Queensland alone. An equine death resulting from an HeV infection in Murwillumbah, New South Wales, Australia, is the most recent incident, demonstrating that HeV remains a matter of grave concern despite the development of an equine vaccine.",
    "HeV is a Henipavirus that commonly infects Pteropid fruit bats (1, 4, 7) . Because of the novelty of the disease, there is very little information regarding the exact pathogenesis of HeV or its modes of transmission. The currently accepted model describes the excreta of bats \u00c1 urine \u00c1 containing HeV particles to be the mode of transmission, as is directly taken up by an intermediate host. In both equines and humans, HeV is purported to infect nervous and respiratory epithelial tissues, which can further disseminate, ultimately resulting in death (5, 3) . Apart from an outlier case comprising an infected canine, HeV has only been verifiably detected among fruit bats, equines, and humans. No human-to-human transmission has been documented, as of yet (4, 7) ."

    "Citation Perlman S, Zhao J. 2013. Human coronavirus EMC is not the same as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. mBio 4(1):e00002-13.",
    "A newly identified betacoronavirus, human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), has been isolated from several patients with respiratory and renal disease in the Middle East. While only a few infected patients have been identified, the mortality of the infection is greater than 50%. Like its better-known cousin severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), HCoV-EMC appears to have originated from bats. In a recent article in mBio, M\u00fcller et al. described several important differences between the two viruses [M. A. M\u00fcller et al., mBio 3(6):e00515-12, 2012, doi:10.1128/mBio.00515-12]. Unlike SARS-CoV, HCoV-EMC can directly infect bat cells. As important, HCoV-EMC does not enter cells using the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin-converting receptor -2 (hACE2) . These results provide a strong incentive for identifying the host cell receptor used by HCoV-EMC. Identification of the receptor will provide insight into the pathogenesis of pulmonary and renal disease and may also suggest novel therapeutic interventions.",
    "If the receptor for HCoV-EMC is a protein, it is predicted to have a distribution similar to that of ACE2 or an even more pronounced localization to the lower respiratory tract, given its apparent lack of human-to-human spread. It will also be interesting to determine whether the receptor is an ectopeptidase. Several alphacoronaviruses, including HCoV-229E and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a pathogenic porcine coronavirus, use aminopeptidase N (APN). Both APN and hACE2 are ectopeptidases and cleave N-terminal amino acids from small peptides. However, in neither instance is the enzymatic activity of the protein required for receptor function, suggesting that the structure of the ectodomain of each molecule is especially amenable to coronavirus binding. In addition to serving as the receptor for SARS-CoV, ACE2 has lung-protective properties. Downregulation of ACE2, as occurs during SARS-CoV infection, is believed to contribute to pathological changes in the lung (7) . It will be of interest to determine if the receptor for HCoV-EMC has similar properties."

Therefore, it is of paramount importance that case identification, laboratory confirmation, and contact tracing should be done within a few days. As contact tracing would be the most time-consuming task, public disclosure of the information on the possible exposure (time and place of the index case) could facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive contact tracing. Our report highlights that all persons staying in the same ER or perhaps using the same toilet, should be considered and evaluated as having been potentially exposed to MERS-CoV. It is not always possible to early identify patients with MERS. Therefore, all health care facilities should have infection prevention and control practices in place."

    "Sample size and data analysis plan As respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most widely recognised respiratory agent associated with severe disease in this age group, we chose it to use for sample size calculations. To calculate the proportion of pathogens detected that are RSV to within \u00b12.5%, we assumed the current proportion to be approximately 12.5%, that conservatively each participant will have an average of eight episodes of ARI over the course of the study, 13 20 62 the intraclass correlation coefficient within individuals is 0.07 (calculated from Lambert et al 13 ) and that 90% of subjects will remain enrolled at study completion ( previous large cohort studies conducted by the investigators had retention rates of 97-98%). 13 63 Consequently, with \u03b1=0.05 and power of 80%, we were required to enrol 138 infants. Similarly, if each subject returns 80% of their weekly nasal swabs, 13 we will be able to estimate the proportion of all swabs positive for RSV to within \u00b10.5%.",
    "Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa As study procedures, including specimen collection and return, are conducted by parents, findings will be free from Hawthorne effects due to frequent interactions with study staff. \u25aa Systematic weekly sampling will provide a control set of specimens for the individual and the cohort, allowing quantification of virusspecific attributable risk to illness. \u25aa Non-random recruitment and enrolment requires awareness and assessment of potential bias and confounding prior to broad-based generalisation. \u25aa Similar studies in the past have oversampled from higher socioeconomic households, and we attempt to avoid this by using a recruitment strategy that targets pregnant women in both public and private hospital settings."

    "Multiple stockpiles and releasing models were adopted in the SNS system, including self-managed inventory, vendormanaged inventory, and just-in-time procurement and supply. 12 The stockpile includes vaccines, antiviral drugs, and PPE. The SNS serves as a national repository for state and local public health authorities to support and resupply materials. It also supports multi-state and national emergencies, such as large-scale pandemics and natural disasters.",
    "To counter potential biological and chemical threats, some countries formulate and provide funds for medical countermeasure (MCM) stockpiles, such as the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in the United States, 8 the National Emergency Stockpile System (NESS) in Canada, 9 the National Medicine Stockpile (NMS) in Australia, 10 and the rotation system in Singapore. 11 These systems are prepared to provide medicine (antiviral drugs, chemical antidotes, and antibiotics), vaccines, medical materials, PPE, and lifemaintaining equipment.",
    "After the SARS outbreak, the Canadian government established a surge supply system of antiviral agents, antibiotics, and PPE (masks, face shields, gloves, gowns). However, at present, a significant proportion of the supplies and equipment in the stockpile is nearly out-of-date and not in accordance with current medical standards or practices. Therefore, the Canadian government is working on new strategies to solve the issue of the high maintenance cost. For instance, the ''mini-clinics'' program was designed as a concept of portable, modular, and flexible medical emergency response delivery. This pre-positioning of ''mini-clinics'' aims to supplement existing medical care facilities that might be overwhelmed in a disaster."

The data may also be searched directly by key words that can be inserted into the search field. Searches that use regular expressions are allowed. The output of a database search is a list of Recode-2 entries in a short format that includes organism name, kingdom, genus, type of recoding event, status of Figure 2 shows an example of sequence annotation for the human oaz1 gene, alongside a diagram of a stimulatory RNA secondary structure, and the Recode-1 logo.",
    "We also plan to continue developing tools for the automatic identification of recoding events from nucleotide sequences. As the field grows and the number of recoded genes progressively increases, it becomes harder to extract data from the relevant literature and a number of novel recoded genes may escape the database. Therefore, we encourage users and researchers in the field to submit their data directly to the Recode-2 database. We are also willing to provide help with the analysis of potential new recoding events."

    "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order nidovirales. Members of the Coronavirus family are positive-strand RNA viruses with large genomes ranging in size from 27-33 kb. The coronavirus genome encodes for a 5 replicase polyprotein (ORF1a and ORF1b) that, in turn, encodes for all the enzymes required for viral RNA replication. The genome also encodes for the 3 structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), which are common to all coronaviruses. The structural proteins are involved in various viral processes, including virus particle formation [4] . Additional subgroup-specific accessory genes are found interspersed among the structural genes, which vary in number and location. Recent studies have shown that the proteins encoded by these genes could be modulators of pathogenicity in the natural host [5] [6] [7] . \u00a7 These authors made equal contribution.",
    "It is noteworthy to say that the report of symptoms in young children, who represent the majority of patients, is based mainly on parental observations, where other possible subjective signs and symptoms fail to be recognized by the parents. Moreover, most of the studies were conducted on patients reporting to hospitals suffering from acute respiratory tract infection. To date, there are only few population-based studies and the question arises whether larger numbers of such studies might reveal the involvement of other body systems.",
    "Nevertheless, high pathogenicity is expected to evolve with coronaviruses. As for HCoV-NL63, the possibility of the development of a recombinant virus variant is high because of its high prevalence and the possibility of a recombination event through co-infection [24] . Moreover, the virus is able to survive for up to seven days in an aqueous solution and respiratory secretions and remains infective at room temperature. In heavily populated regions, direct person-to-person transmission is considered the major route of HCoV-NL63 spread [42, 44] .",
    "It is difficult to distinguish clinical symptoms caused by HCoV-NL63 from those caused by many of the other human viruses, which could make diagnosis and detection of the virus complex. Treatment of patients without a clear diagnosis could result in implementation of expensive and disruptive public health measures, as well as to an increased spread of the disease [68] . Therefore, improved surveillance and diagnosis of respiratory illness could reduce health-care costs drastically [68] [69] [70] ."
