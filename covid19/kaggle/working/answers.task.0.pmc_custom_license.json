    "by infection with a phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus). The main vectors are specific Aedes and Culex spp. mosquitoes, and primary hosts are sheep, goats, and cattle (1, 2) . RVF epidemics usually occur after heavy rainfalls, which inundate ephemeral wetlands and enable large numbers of Aedes spp. mosquito eggs to hatch; it has been hypothesized that these mosquitoes harbor RFV virus (3) (4) (5) . Virus transmission is sustained in locations with more persistent surface water, which provides suitable breeding conditions for other vectors, such as Culex sp. mosquitoes (6) . RVF epidemics among animal herds cause abortion storms, affecting all stages of pregnancy, and high death rates among neonates. Epidemics among humans often cause influenza-like illness, although severe conditions (e.g., hemorrhagic fever and death) have been reported (1, 2) .",

Based on their physiologic and pharmacological properties, imidazoline receptors are classified into three main types: I1R, I2R, and I3R [2] [3] [4] . I1R and I2R have been implicated in hypertension and psychiatric disorder regulation, respectively, while I3R may be involved in insulin secretion [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Compared with mitochondrial I2R, which resides within the monoamine oxidase protein [10] , the clonidine-preferring imidazoline binding sites (known as I1R) are localized to plasma membrane fractions [11, 12] and specifically to synaptic plasma membranes [13] .",

    "Waterfowl are primary hosts for influenza A viruses (IAVs); however, there is sporadic infection of swine and other species that pose a risk of zoonotic spread. Yellow-shouldered bats were shown to be hosts of an IAV, thereby constituting a potential novel reservoir. We show that Pteropus alecto kidney cells (PaKi) are susceptible to infection and sustain replication of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). Importantly, we show that co-infection of PaKi cells results in novel reassortants. Please cite this paper as: Dlugolenski et al. (2013) Bat cells from Pteropus alecto are susceptible to influenza A virus infection and reassortment. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(6), 900-903.",
    "In this study, the susceptibility of Pteropus alecto kidney (PaKi) cells 9 to infection with IAVs was investigated. Initially, a human strain of IAV, that is, A/WSN/33 (H1N1), was investigated for its ability to infect PaKi cells. Cells were infected with A/WSN/33 H1N1 at an MOI of 0\u00c101 in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) without the addition of exogenous trypsin for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. Infected cells were then examined by immunofluorescence using a mouse anti-NP primary antibody and a goat anti-mouse Alexa Flour 488-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 1A , NP staining was observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of PaKi cells indicating that bat cells are susceptible to infection with IAV.",
    "From these findings, the propensity for the generation of reassortant viruses was examined following co-infection of PaKi cells with A/California/04/09 and A/Swine/Illinois/ 02860/08 at an MOI of 3 per virus in DMEM supplemented with 0\u00c15% L-glutamine. Because these viruses require the presence of trypsin for multiple rounds of replication, infections were limited to one round of replication. Supernatants were collected at 24 hpi and plaqued on MDCK cells. Individual plaques were picked and amplified in MDCK cells. Supernatants were collected at 72 hpi, and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from the purified RNA using the Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). The residual RNA was precipitated as described previously, 12 and cDNAs were further purified using the QiaQuick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). cDNA from individual plaques was then screened using triplex TaqMan qPCR specific for each virus with primers and probes specifically targeting the HA, NA, and PB2 gene segments (Table 1) . Reactions were performed using the Quantifast Multiplex qPCR kit (Qiagen)."

The route of infl uenza virus (H5N1) introduction into the markets remains to be established. We suspect that this contamination might have occurred as a consequence of animal movement from outbreak areas or from viruscontaminated cages, trucks, and equipment. Unfortunately, the original sources of animals in the markets could not be identifi ed because birds from different sources were housed in 1 or several cages. Fortunately, no human infection was found during 2007-2008 in those provinces where the viruses were isolated."

    "Flow cytometers are common diagnostic tools used in the immunophenotyping of immune system cells or in the characterization of blood malignancies. With a routine configuration, they allow for the contemporary measurement of four different fluorescent wavelengths, in addition to two signals related to cell size and internal complexity. As such, their application is possible only when the fluorescent signal is associated with discrete particles, such as cells in suspension or microparticles. The flow cytometer has recently been used to detect nucleic acids in a multiplexed format using secondary reagents for signal detection (16) .",
    "In assay development for each group of targets, it will be necessary to consider whether single nucleotide polymorphism detection will be developed through these means, or if it is better for the system to be tolerant for small nucleotide changes that would allow detection even as the target sequence contains mutations. Unique sequences can be selected for each target, allowing specific detection. In addition, redundancy can be included within the assay by conjugating molecular beacons for multiple sequences of the same pathogen or gene onto a single type of bead. The further development of this assay to detect a single target from a complex mixture may be important in several fields of use. We hope to facilitate differential diagnosis, genetic testing, genotyping and gene expression studies through the use of this technology."

Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (IDT) with BamH I and Sac I compatible ends were phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the p2luc vector using the BamH I and Sac I sites between the rluc and fluc reporter genes. 22 Plasmid DNA was purified from cell cultures (Qiagen), and the sequences of all constructs were verified by sequencing.",
    "RNA Synthesis, Purification, and the Frameshift Assay. RNAs for the frameshift assay were transcribed in vitro from p2luc plasmid DNA linearized with PmlI, purified His6-tagged T7 RNA polymerase (10\u00d7), 11.25 mM NTPs, and 2 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin Plus; Promega, N2615) in 200 \u03bcL for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Pyrophosphate was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 13,200 rpm), and RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. Unincorporated NTPs and salt were separated from the RNA by gel filtration (Ilustra MicroSpin G-25 Columns; GE Healthcare). RNAs were heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Samples were lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in water at 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL. RNA integrity and purity were confirmed with 1% agarose gel electrophoresis."

These findings contributed to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices policy recommendation for routine use of meningococcal conjugate vaccines in all persons 11-18 years of age and subsequent recommendations for a booster dose during late adolescence.",
    "With the exception of surveillance for pertussis and legionellosis, the current ABCs case definition includes only culture-proven disease. Although culture remains the standard for diagnosing invasive infections, the use of culture-independent diagnostic tests will probably increase. Validation of culture-independent diagnostics will remain a major consideration for determining whether culture-independent tests are added to the ABCs case definition.",
    "When ABCs began, most cases were identified by reviewing paper laboratory log sheets and computer printouts and most case report forms were abstracted from paper records. The increasing availability of electronic laboratory and medical records may improve timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of reporting (34) . Ensuring that cases are appropriately captured requires an understanding of laboratory information system codes and periodic reviews of how data are imported. Extracting information and transferring it into usable formats remains a challenge (35) .",
    "ABCs and other EIP activities are collaborations between CDC, state and local health departments, and academic institutions. Originally established at 4 sites (California, Connecticut, Oregon, and Minnesota), by 2003 ABCs added Georgia, Maryland, New York, Tennessee, Colorado, and New Mexico, for a total of 10 sites. The sites represent geographic diversity and approximate the racial composition of the US population (2) . Currently, the population under surveillance ranges from 19 to 42 million (up to 12% of the US population), depending on the pathogen.",
    "Although trend data may show indirect evidence of a vaccine's effectiveness, proof of effectiveness requires a more formal epidemiologic investigation to account for other factors that may influence the decline in disease incidence. The ABCs infrastructure was used to conduct case-control studies that confirmed the effectiveness of conjugate meningococcal and pneumococcal vaccines against invasive disease. These very large studies could only have been done through an integrated network, and they highlight the efficiencies gained by maintaining such an infrastructure."

    "Autopsy studies are essential to characterize newly emerging diseases. The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic illustrates this point. It was hypothesized that the corona virus-induced pneumonia was associated with acute lung injury but pathological information was required to confirm this. Autopsy data suggest that lung injury in SARS patients is diffuse alveolar damage and is histopathologically consistent with that of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3] .",
    "In the present issue of Critical Care, Perkins and colleagues revisit the role of autopsy in critically ill patients [1] . These authors evaluated 38 of 49 available autopsy reports in a population of 636 patients (6%). They found that premortem and postmortem findings were in complete agreement in less than one-half of these cases and that major missed diagnoses that might impact on treatment and outcome were present in 39% of the cases reviewed. The most frequently missed diagnoses included myocardial infarction, carcinoma and pulmonary embolism.",
    "Findings on autopsy may reflect systematic shifts in the prevalence of disease states over time and may serve to highlight the limitations of current medical imaging and other diagnostic procedures. In 1983, Goldman and colleagues analyzed 100 randomly selected autopsies from each of the academic years 1960, 1970 and 1980 at one university teaching hospital [2] . In each of these three decades, approximately 10% of autopsies revealed a diagnosis that might have lead to a change in therapy or outcome had it been known prior to the patient's death. In the 1980 autopsy series, there were fewer cases of renal disease and pulmonary embolism but a dramatic increase in systemic bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Renal disease became a less prevalent cause of death because of the introduction of long-term renal replacement therapy. Pulmonary embolus was better diagnosed by improved imaging modalities, and infectious complications increased because newer chemotherapy practices resulted in a greater population of immunocompromised patients. Autopsy findings helped to highlight shifts in clinical practice and to inform the clinician of new sequelae of emerging treatments.",
    "Autopsy studies are case series and they usually represent a small proportion of the total number of patient deaths recorded in the study period. Most often, the reader is not given the total number of patient deaths, so the proportion of patients undergoing autopsy and how representative that study sample might be is never known. The Perkins and colleagues' study, however, gives the reader very complete information [1] . They indicate that 7.7% of their deaths had postmortem examinations and that their study sample represented 6% of the total deaths. This proportion is small and it is not valid to conclude that these results represent the larger patient population. The authors point this out themselves. That is not to say that these observations are uninformative, but it does mean that most autopsy study data suffer from selection bias and this has to be considered when one discusses study results and their implications.",
    "Autopsy series continue to appear in the medical literature and they continue to have an important clinical impact. The present commentary will outline the limitations and contributions of autopsy data. It will include a brief discussion of selection bias in autopsy studies, the important role autopsy plays in tracking disease prevalence over time, its characterization of newly emerging diseases, its contribution to education and quality control programs, and its role in clinical decision-making."

    "The aim of a study in Vietnam was to evaluate viral suppression following combined treatment with a new vaccine containing all three envelope proteins of HBV (pre-S1/pre-S2/S) and lamivudine in CHB patients. The enhanced suppression of viremia in the combination group was reversed after the discontinuation of vaccine treatment, suggesting that booster doses are required for a sustained viral response. Anti-HBs was detected in 55/120 vaccine recipients, but only three patients demonstrated HBsAg loss, indicating that the vaccine-induced anti-HBs was unable to completely neutralize HBsAg in the serum [28].",

In addition, several T-helper epitopes within WHcAg [39, 41] were identified in PBMCs from acutely WHV-infected animals. Significant progress in studying the T cell response of woodchucks was achieved by introduction of the flow cytometric CD107a degranulation assay that enables the detection of WHV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in woodchuck PBMCs and splenocytes [38] . Several studies demonstrated that detection of CD107a, as a degranulation marker, is a suitable method for determination of antigenspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes [71, 72] .",
    "Recombinant adenoviral vectors (AdV) proved to elicit a vigorous and sustained humoral and T cell responses to the transduced antigen [84, 85] . Adenoviral vectors also act as a natural adjuvants causing DC maturation, enhanced antigen presentation and secretion of antiviral cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [86] . However, even single immunization with recombinant adenoviruses may induce immunity, predominantly neutralizing antibodies, against the vector itself. This negative effect of the adenovirusinduced immunity against the vaccine may be overcome by heterologous prime-boost regimen. In particular, subsequent priming immunizations with plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a booster vaccination with AdV seem to be a very promising strategy. DNA prime-adenovirus boost regimen proved to induce more robust and potent immune response in comparison with plasmid DNA alone and provided protection against the pathogen challenge in several animal models of infectious diseases [87] [88] [89] (see also article from E. Barnes in this issue)."

    "The method has a natural real-time implementation in which 1) a first estimate of the reproduction number is available after a lag that depends on the generation interval, and 2) while the epidemic goes on, the estimate is consolidated, and its credible interval narrows. Incorporation of such a statistical estimation framework into real-time surveillance of future infectious disease outbreaks would enhance the ability of epidemiologists to provide timely advice to public health policymakers.",
    "Assume that we would like to compute the daily values R t from day 0 to present day T, before the epidemic has ended. Although daily incident case counts can be known up to day T, provided no delay in reporting occurs, the corresponding counts of secondary cases X t cannot. Secondary case-patients infected before day T, whose illness had a long incubation time, may have clinical onset only after day T. Furthermore, since the exact chain of transmission is seldom observed in practice, attributing secondary cases to previous cases is difficult. Focusing on these 2 issues, we show that the daily counts of symptom onset available until day T are sufficient to estimate R t .",

    "Vertebrate cell surface glycans consist mainly of five-and six-carbon monosaccharides. One remarkable exception is the family of sialic acids, whose members have nine-carbon backbones. 10 Other important features of sialic acids are: (i) the high level of diversity -currently the family comprises over 50 different members, with neuraminic acid considered as the prototype, and includes important variants such as N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) (Figure 1 ), (ii) their presence mainly in higher animals and in certain bacteria, and (iii) their location, typically at the termini of glycan chains, and usually linked to galactose via a2,3-or a2,6glycosidic bonds, or to sialic acid via a2,8-glycosidic bonds. Not surprisingly, their expression on the surface of cells makes sialic acids easily accessible as attachment molecules for a wide variety of microbial pathogens, including many viruses.",
    "Recently it become evident that other pathogenic viruses, including adenovirus type 37 (Ad37, family Adenoviridae), enterovirus type 70 (EV70, family Picornaviridae) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV, family Paramyxoviridae), all with a pronounced tropism for the human eye, share receptor preference with avian influenza A viruses for glycans terminating with a2,3-linked sialic acid (SAa2,3), [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] which is distinct from the SAa2,6-terminated receptor preferred by human influenza A viruses. Here, we review differences in sialic acid preferences of viruses that cause disease in humans and in the distribution of different sialic acids in tissues. Given the ocular tropism of Ad37, EV70 and NDV, and their preference for SAa2,3, we also discuss the human eye as a potential portal of entry for viruses such as the avian influenza A viruses.",
    "Avian influenza A viruses exhibit a strong preference for using a2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor. Until recently, the presumed lack of this receptor in human airways was believed to constitute an efficient barrier to avian influenza A virus infection of humans. Recent zoonotic outbreaks of avian influenza A virus have triggered researchers to analyse tissue distribution of sialic acid in further detail. Here, we review and extend the current knowledge about sialic acid distribution in human tissues, and discuss viruses with ocular tropism and their preference for a2,3linked sialic acid."

This approach seems promising for dengue and perhaps for other diseases and should be further evaluated.",

The other 7 case-patients tested positive for dengue-specific IgM or IgG antibody, although they were febrile at the time of testing (data not shown). Estimating how many patients might have been viremic but were not picked up by the system is difficult, since persons infected with dengue virus are usually viremic from 2 to 3 days before onset of symptoms until defervescence."

    "The new prokaryotic data model offers a significant advantage to name management as the protein name is carried with the protein sequence record; updating the name on that protein record results in automatically propagating the update to all genomes that are annotated with that accession number.",
    "In recent years advanced sequencing techniques have facilitated a substantial increase in whole genome assembly submissions to the public databases. As a result, the RefSeq project has concordantly expanded the depth and breadth of taxa included in the dataset primarily through improvements to several in-house annotation pipelines. All taxa are in scope for RefSeq inclusion; however, annotation is often limited to those organisms for which a high quality primary genome assembly is available with uncontested organism information. Thus, we may exclude some categories of data that don't meet our quality standards. Excluded datasets include: metagenomes, assemblies with low contig N50 values or especially high number of unplaced scaffolds/contigs (i.e. high fragmentation), or genomes that have significant mismatch or indel variation compared to other closely related genomes for the species (e.g. some prokaryotes).",
    "In 2015, we released a comprehensive annotation update for RefSeq prokaryotic genomes in order to harmonize genome annotation and complete the transition to the new protein data model. A new prokaryotic protein name database, name specifications, and an evidence-based strategy were developed and are currently in the process of being deployed. Thus far, over 3 million protein records have updated names in an initial demonstration of the approach."

    "H epatitis E virus (HEV) belongs to the family Hepeviridae and genus Hepevirus. Among humans worldwide, HEV is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis. The disease is generally self-limiting, but mortality rates are high among pregnant women and young infants. Chronic HEV infection is a problem for immunocompromised patients, such as those who have received a solid organ transplant and those with HIV infection. In addition to humans, HEV has been found in the other mammals: pigs, boar, deer, rodents, ferrets, rabbits, mongoose, bats, cattle, sheep, foxes, minks, and horses (1-3). Among the 4 known HEV genotypes, HEV1 and HEV2 infect only humans; whereas, HEV3 and HEV4 can infect humans, pigs, and other mammals. Human infections with HEV3 and HEV4 have been associated with consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat (4). Traditionally, HEV infection is mainly transmitted through water contaminated with infected feces. Since water supplies and sanitary infrastructures have been improved, animals have become a major source of human HEV infection. We detected HEV in fecal samples from dromedary camels in the Middle East.",

Current knowledges on the relationship between PLA 2 gene mutations and human diseases are summarized in Table 2 .

Heparin decomplexation assay. Heparin is known as a model polyanion competing agent with nucleic acids for electrostatic interactions with polycations, 3 and it has been used to dissociate siRNA from several polycationic carriers. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Thus, heparin was used in this work to dissociate siRNA from PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer. In order to determine the most favorable condition of heparin treatment to release the highest siRNA content from the dendriplexes, siRNA-G4NH2 at N/P 10 were formed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer, 10 as described in the Experimental Section, incubated with heparin in TE 1X pH 8 buffer at 37\uf0b0C for different time points, and frozen at -20\uf0b0C overnight. The final heparin concentration was 5 mg \uf0b4 mL -1 corresponding to 455 U per 1 \uf06dg siRNA calculated based on 1000 U per 1 mL. 4 The final siRNA concentration after dilution of the dendriplexes to 1 mL was 80 nM. siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes incubated in presence or absence of heparin (minimum of three independent batches, n = 3) were quantitatively analyzed using PicoGreen \u00ae assay 11 in Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT) for the siRNA content released, which was calculated using a linear calibration curve (siRNA concentration vs. fluorescent units). Thus, siRNA released from the dendriplexes due to heparin treatment was determined based on the difference between the siRNA content truly complexed with G4NH2 (siRNA CE was applied in the calculations) and the free siRNA released and remaining in the dendriplexes dispersion. Appropriate control (PAMAM G4NH2 in presence of heparin, but no siRNA) was used as blank. The results are shown in Figure S2 , and indicate that the siRNA is released from G4NH2 dendrimer due to treatment of the dendriplexes with heparin. The incubation time of 30 min released the highest siRNA content -80% on average, and narrower standard deviation -out of the total siRNA complexed with G4NH2, and thus, it was chosen as standard time for all further heparin decomplexation assay experiments. constitutively express eGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) according to GenTarget protocol. 12 Briefly, A549 cells (passage 5) were seeded in 24-well microplate (25,000 cells per well) and cultured in 500 \uf06dL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% AB (v/v) for 24 h at 37\uf0b0C and 5% CO 2 (Thermo Scientific Incubator, NAPCO 8000WJ). Cells were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, and fresh culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% AB, v/v) was added to them, following 50 \uf06dL per well of eGFP lentiviral particles. Cells were kept in incubator for 72 h at 37\uf0b0C and 5% CO 2 , and after that, they were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, and the puromycin selective medium was added to them (DMEM + 10% FBS + 2.5 \uf06dg \uf0b4 mL -1 puromycin selective antibiotic; concentration was previously determined by a kill curve). Cells were cultured under this selective condition for 4 weeks, 13 dendriplexes alone were attempted to be formulated as pMDI. Dendriplexes at N/P 10 were prepared in RNase-free DI-water, the aqueous dispersion (siRNA and PAMAM G4NH2 at the same amount as what is loaded into CSLA and mannitol particles) was placed into the pressure proof glass vial, which was frozen (-20\uf0b0C) and lyophilized. The canister was crimp sealed with a 63 \uf06dL metering valve, and a known volume of propellant HFA-227 was filled into it so that the siRNA concentration was the same for pMDI formulations containing dendriplexes loaded into CSLA or mannitol particles. Then, the formulation was placed into sonication bath (30 min at 15 -20\uf0b0C) to disperse the dendriplexes in the propellant. As a result, the dendriplexes were observed getting stuck on the wall of the glass vial, and even after sonication for a long time, they did not disperse in the propellant as seen in Figure S5 . Thus, it was not possible to have pMDI formulations of free siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes for further comparison with those prepared with CSLA and mannitol particles. Therefore, this result presents the difficulty of formulating siRNA-based dendriplexes alone in propellant HFA, and strongly suggests that an appropriate micro-carrier is needed for the job -such as CSLA and mannitol which are being proposed in this work.

    "Interacting residues tend to build clusters in protein sequences, so the support vector machine can easily be applied [83] . Ofran and Rost [68] proposed a simple neural network that can predict which protein fragments interact. The 94% high fidelity predictions for 34 of 333 proteins were confirmed experimentally. In the case of good predictions, almost 70% are confirmed experimentally, and at least one interaction patch is predicted correctly in 20% of cases, i.e. in 66 of 333 protein complexes. Those results show that effective prediction using only sequence information is possible. The inclusion of evolutionary information and structural descriptors improves those methods.",
    "The term Interactome describes the set of all molecular interactions in cells, especially in the context of protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for most cellular processes, so the full representation of the interaction repertoire is needed to understand the cell molecular machinery at the system biology level. In this short review, we compare various methods for predicting protein-protein interactions using sequence and structure information. The ultimate goal of those approaches is to present the complete methodology for the automatic selection of interaction partners using their amino acid sequences and/or three dimensional structures, if known. Apart from a description of each method, details of the software or web interface needed for high throughput prediction on the whole genome scale are also provided. The proposed validation of the theoretical methods using experimental data would be a better assessment of their accuracy.",
    "Up to now, all the computational algorithms have only used single machine learning methods for the analysis and prediction of protein-protein interactions [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] , or the statistical analysis of interacting patches of protein surfaces [75, 149, 161, 162] . Our experience clearly supports the idea that each machine learning algorithm performs better for selected types of training data [163, 164] . Some have very high specificity, others focus more on sensitivity. Sometimes one can have a very large number of positives in training, but it is also common for some specific types of experiments with only a few confirmed instances known. In most cases, the proper selection of negatives is not trivial. In the case of protein-protein interactions, one should use a rich variety of input data for training, such as sequences, short sequence motifs, evolutionary information, genomic context, enzymatic classification, or the known or predicted local or global structure of interacting proteins. Using this data, one can apply various types of machine learning methods trained on the same set of positives and negatives, for example neural networks, the support vector machine, the random forest, decision trees, or rough sets. The crucial step of meta-prediction is building a consensus between those various prediction methods. Since systematic errors of multiple methods are usually randomly distributed, the consensus approach can be used to select a common prediction, probably the most accurate one [165] . Thanks to its easy parallelization, a consensus method can improve the accuracy of any single machine learning method without extending the time of prediction (the time needed is equal to the slowest used machine learning algorithm). The combination of various approaches done by Sen and Kloczkowski [166] provides the solid justification for this statement. They combine four different methods, such as data mining using Support Vector Machines, threading through protein structures, prediction of conserved residues on the protein surface by analysis of phylogenetic trees, and the Conservatism of Conservatism method of Mirny and Shakhnovich [167] [168] [169] . A consensus method predicts protein-protein interface residues by combining sequence and structure-based methods. Therefore, we hypothesize that consensus approaches are the main tools to handle the prediction of protein-protein interactions on the whole proteome level, the ultimate goal of system biology."

    "Fear of being socially marginalized and stigmatized as a result of a disease outbreak may cause people to deny early clinical symptoms and may contribute to their failure to seek timely medical care (5) . Such fear can ultimately increase stigmatization when cases are identified at a later date (11) . Stigmatization associated with discrimination often has social and economic ramifications that intensify internalized stigmatization and feelings of fear (13) .",
    "While persons, agencies, and governments sought to identify modes of transmission, strategies for disease containment, and treatment for SARS, fear spread unchecked throughout the global community. Fear of SARS arose from the underlying anxiety about a disease with an unknown cause and possible fatal outcome (5) . Stigmatization of potential SARS patients emerged early in the outbreak, as global media reported dramatic stories from Asia in print media, television, and the Internet. Headlines from the English-language press heightened the fear. \"Concern is mounting over the continuing spread of the deadly SARS virus. Some experts say it could have a similar impact to the 1918 flu epidemic that killed 50 million-or the current world HIV crisis,\" wrote the British Broadcasting Corporation from London, England (6) . \"China has threatened to execute or jail for life anyone who deliberately spreads the killer SARS virus,\" stated the Cable News Network from Beijing, China (7) .",

The relationships developed during these group discussions allowed team members to monitor and document ongoing stigmatizing situations related to the disease outbreak in real time and to deal more effectively with intentional and unintentional discrimination.",

Comparisons were made between hospitals that would need to admit and manage patients with suspected EVD and those that would provide immediate care and subsequently transfer suspected EVD cases to another specialised centre.",
    "No responses were obtained from the three affected countries with widespread and intense EVD transmission. Moreover, 6 countries (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, United Kingdom and USA) have previously reported a case or cases imported from a country with intense EVD transmission. Our survey reported on participating hospitals from Nigeria (n = 3), United Kingdom (n = 9) and USA (n = 3) only, with no respondents from other countries. As the number of respondents differed substantially with low numbers in Nigeria and USA, results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, whilst UK and USA have many of the preparedness activities implemented, responses from Nigeria indicate lack of essential PPE and lack of periodical training to ensure staff competency and safety in use of PPE."

Evolution of this virus should be closely monitored so that prevention and control measures can be taken should it become more virulent.",
    "Our study provides genomic evidence and molecular confirmation of a novel reovirus in mink. Although there is no direct evidence to prove the origin of MRV1-HB-A, the close genetic relationship of MRV1-HB-A with strains from humans and swine indicated a high probability that MRV1-HB-A resulted from a reassortment of human and swine strains. In view of the lack of sequence data for the reovirus from mink in public databases, addition of the complete genome sequencing information for the mink reovirus will aid in the characterization of mammalian reovirus diversity and evolution. Although MRVs were assumed to cause rather mild respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases, recent findings indicate the occurrence of higher virulent MRV strains in man and other mammals. To be prepared for the potential emergence of more virulent variants, we should carefully monitor virus evolution in real time."

They found that severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (serum interleukin-6 concentration >1000 pg/ml) was best predicted in their population by a bypass time in excess of 97 min and cardiac ejection fraction below 40%. Thus, by targeting their predefined high-risk patients to receive hydrocortisone, they showed recipients to have significantly lower interleukin-6 levels, reduced duration of ventilation and catecholamine support, and reduced duration of stay in the intensive care unit and the hospital.

Gerlach and coworkers [10] looked at dose-response characteristics when long-term NO is used and found that these characteristics changed. Patients could become sensitized to NO, such that the number of responders to low NO doses increased and some became nonresponders at higher NO doses. It would seem that constant dose NO is not right for all patients throughout their treatment, and that there is more inter-patient and intrapatient NO dose-response variability than we had thought. Titrating doses at each step may improve long-term benefits from NO therapy."

Other groups have used alternative strategies to investigate SARS-CoV replication, including using PCR capable of amplifying subgenomic RNA molecules produced during replication (15) .

Generally, miRNAs are derived from introns or intergenes of eukaryotic organisms or viruses and serve as regulators of gene expression [2] . The miRNA-mediated RNA interference includes two patterns. One is perfectly base-paring with 3' UTR of target mRNA leading to degradation of mRNA. The other is imperfectly binding to target 3' UTR of mRNA resulting in the inhibition of mRNA translation.

When picornavirus epidemiology is the primary research focus, we recommend using >2 primer pairs to maximize the detection of HRVs. Under our conditions, pairs 1-4 returned the highest number of positive results, and the rtP-CRs behaved similarly but with reduced sensitivity. The rtPCR that used pair 5 did not amplify known HEVs.",
    "Many possible reasons could cause discrepant virus testing results between different sites, including changes to specimen integrity resulting from transport and variable amplifi cation resulting from low viral loads. The effects of viral load can be seen in this study: specimens in population 1 that were positive with multiple (>6 separate pairs) primer pairs had a mean cycle threshold of 33.3 (combining results from both rtPCRs), whereas those with <6 positive results had means of 39.3 cycles. Most (29/33) specimens with <3 positive primer pairs were negative by rtPCR. Amplifi cation variability can also be attributed to the substantial nucleotide sequence diversity between HRVs and the different temporal and clinical characteristics of the 2 specimen populations we used. Population diversity is a feature of HRV studies in the literature."

To assess SARS patients' risk for future reinfection, we conducted a longitudinal study of immunity in convalescent patients."

    "IFITs are among the most potently expressed proteins of a group of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) 3 , which are the culmination of virally triggered signalling pathways that lead to the production of interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 and other cytokines. They are evolutionarily conserved from mammals to fish, of which in humans there are four well-characterized paralogues, IFIT1 (p56/ISG56), IFIT2 (p54/ISG54), IFIT3 (p60/ISG60) and IFIT5 (p58/ISG58), ranging in mass from 54 to 56 kDa. IFITs are composed of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are a degenerate, 34-amino acid, helix-turn-helix motif usually present in multiple copies as tandem arrays that generate solenoid-type scaffolds well suited for mediating protein-protein interactions 4 ",
    "Finally, given that bacterial mRNAs also bear a free 5\u2032-PPP and can access the cytosol during infection to potentiate induction of interferon-\u03b2 26 , it is plausible that IFITs could also play a role in anti-bacterial innate immunity. Taken together, it is clear that unravelling the structural details that underlie IFIT biology will improve our understanding of the complex interplay between pathogens and host innate immunity, and hopefully pave the way for the development of new immunotherapeutics.",
    "The structural basis for IFIT recognition of foreign RNA described here validates the new paradigms put forth for how this family of ISGs carry out their effector functions, and brings to the forefront the versatility of the TPR motif in recognizing diverse ligands, paralleling established receptors of the innate immune system such as those containing leucine-rich repeats 1 .",
    "The rest of the cylindrical cavity is created by the intervening pivot helices and the Nterminal TPRs from Subdomain III. Subdomain III begins with two typical TPRs followed by an interrupting helix (\u03b121), which inverts the direction of the final TPR9 such that it forms an S-shaped appendage at the C-terminus with two potential ligand-interacting concave surfaces ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 5b ). The deep pocket formed by this atypical arrangement of TPRs is approximately 28\u00c5 deep by 15\u00c5 wide, and is lined with an expansive collection of positively charged residues well suited for the accommodation of nucleic acid (Fig. 1c )."

These 2 picornaviruses share an identical genomic organization, have similar functional RNA secondary structures, and are classifi ed within the same genus (www.ictvonline.org/virusTax-onomy.asp) because of their high sequence homology (1) . However, despite their common genomic features, these 2 groups of viruses have different phenotypic characteristics. In vivo, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas enteroviruses infect primarily the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other sites such as the central nervous system. However, some enteroviruses exhibit specifi c respiratory tropism and thus have properties similar to rhinoviruses (2) (3) (4) (5) . In vitro, most HRVs and HEVs differ by their optimal growth temperature, acid tolerance, receptor usage, and cell tropism. The genomic basis for these phenotypic differences between similar viruses is not yet fully understood.",
    "In summary, we have highlighted the large genomic diversity of the most frequent human respiratory viral infection. Our phylogenetic analysis has characterized circulating strains relative to reference strains and has identifi ed a previously unknown enterovirus genotype. We have shown that recombination also contributes to rhinovirus evolution in its natural environment."

    "Efficient induction of eukaryotic \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting requires two in cis RNA elements (1, 6) . The first one is a hepta-nucleotides' slippery site sequence of X XXY YYZ, where the recoding occurs. Analysis indicated X can be any three identical nucleotides whereas Y represents three A or U, and Z is A, U or C. In addition, a downstream stimulator RNA structure located 6-7 nt away from the slippery site is also needed for efficient frameshifting. This downstream RNA stimulator is usually an H-type RNA pseudoknot in which nucleotides from a hairpin loop form base pairs with singlestranded region outside the hairpin. This leads to a topology featuring two helical stems of base pairing region (stems 1 and 2) connected by two single-stranded loops (loops 1 and 2) with a quasi-continuous RNA double-helical structure. However, not all RNA pseudoknots can stimulate \u00c01 frameshifting and non-pseudoknot RNA element has been characterized to be responsible for inducing \u00c01 frameshifting in HIV-1 (7, 8) .",

In response to the programmed frameshifting signals in messenger RNA (mRNA), the ribosome is induced to move one base backward in the 5 0 direction, and then continues translation in the new \u00c01 reading frame. The ratio between the two protein products from frameshifting can be determined by the frameshift efficiency of the stimulation signals and can be a key factor for the propagation of virus within the host. It has been suggested to be a potential antiviral target for the interference of viral propagation (5) ."

    "In 2005 we published the first study to show that mortality can be reduced by prone ventilation [1] . This study followed the large trial by the Prone-Supine Study Group of Gattinoni and colleagues published in the NEJM in 2001 [2] and another in 2005 that failed to show benefit [3] . We have speculated that the earlier trials failed to show benefit because the protocols of these studies stipulated that physicians do not change ventilator settings during the period of prone ventilation (in order to standardize the changes in gas exchange induced by this maneuver).

However, analysis stratified according to quartile of PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio at enrollment showed no significant differences in outcome in this study. They assumed a priori that benefits will accrue only to those with severe ARDS and so they report that prone ventilation helps this group, although their analysis shows severity of ARDS has little to do with improved survival. The authors do not acknowledge our previous communications in the literature. We point to more than a matter of priority in science, which is important in itself. Our findings suggest that prone ventilation may be beneficial in reducing ventilator-induced lung injury in all ventilated patients and this needs to be investigated in a wider context."

    "Insects have diverse mechanisms to combat infection by pathogens. Many insects are protected by a layer of antimicrobial secretions on their exterior, and by a gut environment that is hostile to pathogens. When pathogens move beyond these defences, the epithelium is often sufficient to stop further progress. Should pathogens defeat the morphological defences of insects, they are often met by efficient cellular and humoral immune defences. Insect immunity shows many parallels to the innate immune responses of humans and other vertebrates, involving a diverse set of actions including the secretion of antimicrobial peptides, phagocytosis, melanization and the enzymatic degradation of pathogens (Hoffmann, 2003; Hultmark, 2003) . Further, insect immune pathways share both an overall architecture and specific orthologous components with the innate immune system of vertebrates (Beutler, 2004) . This suggests both a shared root for these immune pathways and selection to conserve many components over hundreds of millions of years.",
    "Future genomic work can help reveal whether other species of highly social insects, including ants, wasps, bees and termites, also appear to have more simplistic innate defence systems. More generally, social and solitary insects with more 'exposed' life histories are predicted to have a greater number and higher functional diversity of immunepathway genes and end products, when compared to sister taxa that are more sheltered. Data on parasite and pathogen abundance across social (e.g. Boomsma et al., 2005) and solitary insects could be used as a surrogate for disease loads in different taxa, although field and epidemiological data are most needed to assess the relative fitness impacts of disease and the efficacies of different lines of defence.",
    "With respect to the final hypothesis, bees, like many social insects, are relentlessly hygienic, removing alien organisms from their nests, and secreting antimicrobial substances that can reduce the viability and growth of pathogens in the colonies. Bees also raise their young in individual cells using, as a food source, substances with strongly antimicrobial properties (e.g. royal jelly; Albert & Klaudiny, 2004) . A testament to this hygiene is the fact that, even when facing severe colony-level infections by bacterial pathogens such as Paenibacillus larvae (for which < 10 spores are normally fatal to young larvae (Brodsgaard et al., 1998) , the vast majority of larvae show no signs of exposure (Evans & Pettis, 2005) . 'Social' barriers might also reduce exposure to minor, opportunistic, pathogens or saprophytes that have been proposed as generalized targets of insect immune defences (Hultmark, 2003) . While bees do carry an assemblage of microbes, and bacteria in particular (Gilliam, 1997) , exposure to these microbes is arguably lower than in free-living Drosophila (decaying plant material as larvae and adults) or Anopheles (septic aqueous environments as larvae). Further, bacteria found in bee colonies have only rarely been associated with disease pathologies, despite extensive study. In fact, some resident bacteria in colonies appear to add to external defences through their inhibition of bee pathogens (Evans & Armstrong, 2006) .",
    "Two experiments were carried out to screen for immune-related transcript changes. In the first, adult worker bees from a single local A. mellifera ligustica colony were removed, then injected abdominally with either dilute phosphate-buffered saline or saline solution containing 103 live cells of E. coli or 103 vegetative spores of the honey bee bacterial pathogen Paenibacillus larvae. These bees, along with uninjected controls, were maintained for 24 h at high humidity and 34 \u00b0C and then were immediately frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C prior to RNA extraction. To assess immune responses following natural infection, eight 1st-instar larval bees from the same stock were given per os challenges of P. larvae in their food [(50 spores/\u00b5l as described in Evans (2004) ], then maintained 24 h at 34 \u00b0C and high humidity. Parallel control larvae were given the same food without bacterial spores. All samples were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C following incubation."

    "H epatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide (1) . Four HEV genotypes belonging to the species Orthohepevirus A are commonly found in humans (HEV-1 through HEV-4). Genotypes 1 and 2 seem to be restricted to humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 also occur in domesticated and wild animals. Zoonotic transmission by ingestion of contaminated meat, mainly from pigs, is the most likely zoonotic source of infection (1) .",

This finding suggests that HEV-7 is a strongly diversified clade of viruses that might need to be further subclassified. HEV-7 was recently shown to belong to the same serotype as HEV-1-4 (12) . Therefore, we conducted a preliminary serologic analysis with a subset of 210 specimens (35 per country) by adapting a human HEV ELISA (EU-ROIMMUN, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) for application with camel serum. Serum was tested at a 1:100 dilution. The signalto-noise ratio was optimized by normalizing the optical density (OD) of test samples against ODs of a reference serum included in every run (online Technical Appendix Figure, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/22/7/16-0168-Techapp1.pdf)."

    "T he possibility of an influenza pandemic presents a major public health challenge. Since 2003, outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) have occurred in Asian, European, and African countries. As of August 21, 2006, the total number of cases was 240 and the number of deaths was 141 (1) . A crossover of current human influenza virus with the avian H5N1 virus could result in a virus capable of human-tohuman transmission and the start of a new pandemic.",
    "In line with the protection motivation theory (8), a measure of risk perception was constructed by multiplication of seriousness (scale 1-10) and vulnerability (scale 1-5). To make the scores comparable, the seriousness score was first divided by 2. To normalize the skewed distribution of the new variable, a square-root transformation was performed, which resulted in a measure of risk perception on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high).",
    "Despite extensive media attention for avian influenza, knowledge about risk perception of AI is scarce. We therefore explored the conditions for effective nonmedical interventions. If an influenza pandemic occurs, public health authorities will be dependent on the willingness and ability of the public to adhere to recommendations regarding personal hygiene, vaccination and prophylaxis, quarantine, travel restrictions, or closing of public buildings (2, 3) . Adherence, however, cannot be assumed. Evaluation of the outbreak of H7N7 AI in the Netherlands in 2003 showed that adherence to antiviral therapy and behavioral measures, such as wearing face masks and goggles, was low (4).",
    "Our study has several implications for public health policy and research. Although in all countries an influenza pandemic is perceived as a real risk, the level of self-efficacy appears to be rather low. When developing preparedness plans for an influenza pandemic, specific attention should therefore be paid to risk communication and how perceived self-efficacy can be increased; otherwise, adherence to preventive measures may be low.

To demonstrate this, we seeded MSCs on the surface of Ci-I hydrogels with or without the loaded icaritin. enzymes might not be significant enough to support such extensive cell infiltration within the short period of 24 h. We speculated that the cell infiltration was likely facilitated by the disruption of the weak host\u2212guest cross-links in Ci-I hydrogels by cellular forces. Therefore, we speculate that, once implanted into the defect sites, the icaritin-laden Ci-I gelatin hydrogels can promote the recruitment and infiltration of endogenous cells into the hydrogel matrix, thereby speeding up the repair and regeneration of bone defects.",

    "The restricted and highly compartmentalized social structure of livestock camels would provide population niches in which viruses can differentiate in isolation after bottleneck-type transmission events. This situation holds promise for control of the spread of MERS-CoV through flock management practices, and it also suggests a rather simple way of avoiding camel-to-human transmission by avoiding camels <2 years of age. Camel calves are not easily accessible by humans and instinctually avoid humans. They are generally separated from their mothers after 12 months of age (i.e., at an age when they are still likely to be infected with MERS-CoV). Humans normally come into contact with calves only after the animals have been separated from their mothers. A change in this practice (i.e., postponing separation until the calves are older) might reduce the risk for camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission.",

(8) . Nevertheless, virus can be maintained in flocks over several weeks or months, as exemplified by the detection of the same virus clade in March and June on 1 dairy farm.",
    "We sequenced genomes of 9 virus isolates, representing 3 different phylogenetic lineages, from dromedaries on the 3 farms. Phylogeny of full genomes showed that all viruses clustered according to their place of origin. The phylogenetic position of 1 of these clades suggested recent separation from viruses circulating in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia; some of the animals in the breeding flock from which the viruses were isolated had been moved temporarily to Saudi Arabia for grazing. The other clade separated from these viruses somewhat earlier, but it shared recent common ancestors with other viruses from the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Samples collected in June from animals on the dairy farm yielded viruses from the same clade as that for viruses derived from different animals sampled on the same farm in March (dairy farm samples I and II) (Figure) ."

    "T he emergence and reemergence of zoonotic diseases are becoming increasingly important issues for numerous reasons, including deforestation and habitat fragmentation, increased globalization of travel and trade, urbanization, and bioterrorism concerns. Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infl uenza, transmis-sible spongiform encephalopathies, Rift Valley fever, West Nile disease, anthrax, and Escherichia coli O157 infections recently have resulted in major public health and economic concerns, as well as public anxiety. Over 60% of the 1,415 known human pathogens and 75% of the 175 emerging pathogens are zoonotic (1) . Many emerging diseases have spilled over from wildlife directly (e.g., West Nile virus infection, hantavirus infection, and Lyme disease) or indirectly through domestic or peridomestic species (e.g., avian infl uenza, SARS, and Nipah virus infections, plague) (2) . Early detection of new disease outbreaks in domestic and wild animals is an essential prerequisite of disease control and eradication. Development of methods for early detection of diseases in free-ranging wildlife is problematic.",
    "Coyote samples were processed by following protocols used for histologic examination and mycobacterial culture of white-tailed deer samples (6, 10) .

    "Cross-reactivity of these anti-SARS Abs against human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and HCoV OC43 were determined by Western blotting. The Abs produced reacted with recombinant SARS virus nucleocapsid protein, but not with HCoV 229E or HCoV OC43.",
    "Coronaviruses are a group of large, enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are known to associate with respiratory, enteric and neurological diseases in humans and domestic animals [2] . Many researchers have reported cross-reactivity with other HCoV when the diagnostic systems are based on SARS N protein [9, 14] . It is therefore important to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic test for SARS-CoV that does not show this cross-reactivity with the other HCoVs. Only two coronaviruses, HCoV 229E (Group I) and HCoV OC43 (Group II), have previously been known to cause illness in humans [2] . These coronaviruses are responsible for 10\u223c35% of upper respiratory tract infections [9] . Another human coronaviruses, HCoV NL63 and Co HKU1, were reported in 2004 and 2005 [11, 13] . As such, a SARS diagnostic system that cross-reacts with HCoVs could easily result in false-positive reactions. Previous researchers have tried to develop a monoclonal Ab against SARS N protein based ELISA. Some checked cross-reactivity with chicken CoV [3] , HCoV OC43 [8] and various CoVs [1] . We need more Ab candidates for the diagnosis of SARS. In this study, we checked Abs cross-reactivity against SARS virus with HCoVs 229E and OC43, before developing a diagnostic system. Because the polyclonal and monoclonal Abs produced in this study did not react with HCoV 229E or HCoV OC43 in Western blotting, it could be possible to develop a specific diagnostic system to detect SARS-CoV in infected patients with theses Abs. Crossreactivity with HCoV NL63 and Co HKU1, newly arising HCoVs, should be confirmed to strengthen the specificity of our Abs against SARS-CoV.",
    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus nucleocapsid (N) protein is abundantly released in the patients' blood during early infection [6] , which suggested that the N protein is a suitable candidate for diagnostic applications. Detection of specific circulating Abs is potentially a highly sensitive and specific way to diagnose SARS. However, detection of SARS Abs from early-infected patients is difficult, because most patients experience IgG seroconversion on average 20 days after the onset of symptoms [5] . On the other hand, a highly conserved motif (FYYLGTGP: 111-118 a.a.), occurs in the N-terminal half of all coronavirus N proteins, and other conserved residues are reported to occur near this highly conserved motif [6] . The cross reactivity regions between SARS-coronavirus (CoV) and porcine CoVs were located in 120-208 a.a. of N protein [12] . Cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV N protein and anti-human CoV (HCoV) 229E Abs or anti-HCov OC43 Abs has been reported [14] . It is therefore necessary to develop an assay that shows no cross-reactivity with other CoVs, especially HCoVs, to detect SARS proteins. Such a test could be used for early detection and follow-up of patients during treatment. In this study, we raised polyclonal and monoclonal Abs using a recombinant SARS N protein to develop a specific diagnostic test for SARS. The cDNA of SARS-CoV strain Hanoi provided by Dr. Kariwa of Hokkaido University was used as a template for PCR by Accupower premix (Bioneer, Korea). The full length of the SARS-CoV N gene was inserted into vector pET21a (Novagen, German). After transformation, E. coli strain Origami B (DE3) pLysS competent cells were induced using 1 mM IPTG (Invitrogen, USA) at 37 o C for 4 h. The expressed proteins were purified using the His-Bind kits (Novagen, German). Production of polyclonal and monoclonal Abs was performed as described by Shang et al. [7] . Human coronaviruses, HCoV 229E (ATCC, VR-730) and HCoV OC43 (ATCC, VR-1558), were infected to MRC-5 cells (Korean Cell Line Bank). Replication of these viruses was confirmed by RT-PCR of cell lysates infected with HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43. RT-PCR was performed as described in a previous study [10] . To examine whether Abs against recombinant N protein of the SARS virus react with other HCoVs, we performed Western blotting on recombinant SARS N protein or cell lysates infected with HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43. In our previous study, the antigenicity of recombinant of SARS-CoV N protein was checked with a mouse anti-SARS-CoV N protein monoclonal IgG2a (Zymed, USA), and convalescent SARS serum provided by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam [4] . We selected polyclonal and monoclonal Abs that showed the highest reactivity with the N protein in an ELISA. With these Abs, we determined cross-reactivity against cell lysates infected with HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 by Western blotting. The viruses in these cells lysates were confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 ). Abs reacted with recombinant N protein, but did not react with HCoVs in cell lysates (Fig. 2) . To determine the specificity of these Abs, cross reactivity with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (coronavirus group I) and mouse hepatitis virus (coronavirus group II) were analyzed by Western blotting but showed no reaction (data not shown)."

    "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process which plays an important role in eliminating damaged organelles and long-live proteins for maintenance of cellular homestasis (Mizushima, 2009) . During autophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes that are destined for fusion with lysosomes for content degradation. Under stress conditions such as starvation, autophagic acitivity is greatly augmented from its basal levels, providing recyclable resources that help maintain metabolism and ATP levels for cell survival (Rabinowitz and White, 2010) . Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy is involved in various physiologic and pathologic processes including cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolism, viral infections and immune response, etc. (Deretic, 2012; Levine and Deretic, 2007; Mihaylova and Shaw, 2011; Shintani and Klionsky, 2004; Yang et al., 2011) .",
    "In summary, results of this study demonstrate that the coronavirus papain-like proteases along with their transmembrane anchors activate incomplete autophagy by interacting with Beclin1. Autophagosomes induced by CoV PLP2-TM/PLpro-TMs may provide a platform for viral targeting Beclin1 to sequester STING and possibly other critical innate signaling components to impede downstream antiviral responses, thereby promoting viral replication. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of autophagosome induction by CoV PLPs and the exact roles that autophagy plays in coronavirus replication, antiviral innate immune responses and disease pathogenesis."

    "The prevalence of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), and Chlamydophila (C.) felis was studied in cats of an animal shelter in Korea. Total 78 cats without ocular and upper respiratory tract disease were examined. Specimens were obtained from ocular conjunctiva and oropharynx. Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR, three pathogens were simultaneously detected. In examined 78 cats, 49 (63%) cats were positive for FHV-1. However, all specimens were negative for C. felis and FCV. In conclusion, many cats recovered from FHV-1 infection remain subclinical carriers in shelter environment."

While some, for example, have questioned the provision of treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis,in certain contexts, in that it may not be cost effective, Farmer and Nardell 27 stress that it is important to avoid the trap of medical health nihilism, in that even though poverty and inequality persist, it is necessary to, nevertheless, \"move forward with focused interventions and insist on universal access to high-quality TB care (p1015).\"",
    "An important debatein the literature relates to discussions of medical nihilism. The McKeown Thesis derives from McKeown's argument that in certain contexts the fall in the crude mortality rate over time was largely \"due not to life-saving advancements in the field of medicine or public health, but instead to improvements in overall standards of living (p.725),\" and especially those related to advances in nutrition that resulted from improved economic conditions 25 . Debates about McKeown's thesis have persisted in light of the question, are \"public health ends better served by targeted interventions or by broadbased efforts to redistribute the social, political, and economic resources that determine the health of populations?

More recently, a combination of RT-PCR and Southern hybridization on human brain autopsy samples provided more definitive experimental evidence for the neurotropism and neuroinvasion of HCoV and its possible association with multiple sclerosis (12) . Preliminary work in Hong Kong with RT-PCR on SARS autopsy specimens of brain tissue were positive for SARS-CoV, although electron microscopy did not show ultrastructural features of the virus (W.-C. Yu, unpub. data). The findings from our patient are not compatible with multiple sclerosis, and the PCR result suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) is affected by SARS-CoV."

The constructs were then transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After induction by isopropyl\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were sonicated, and the recombinant proteins were extracted with 1.5% sarcosine. Finally these recombinant proteins were bound by BD TALON metal affinity resins (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and examined by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

    "profound respiratory failure secondary to infection in an immunosuppressed patient. 5 Most of the literature reviews have already shown the good application of ECMO in SLE-induced diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. 6 Our case report presents a promising application of rescue ECMO therapy in a lupus-induced immunosuppressed patient with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, 7 ",
    "Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has evolved as a treatment option for patients having rev ersible severe respiratory failure who are deter iorating on conventional ventilation. 1,2 We describe our experience with a patient who received ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: This is a retrospective case report for which approval for presentation has been obtained from the administration of the department and can be submitted upon request. Our patient was an 18-yearold female with a long history of SLE with nephritis who was recently started on immunosuppression, admitted with azotemia, fluid overload, and respiratory failure, and initially improved with fluid removal. 3 Her respiratory status later worsened with saturations in the low 80s despite 100% FiO 2 and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cm H 2 O. She had a trial of prone positioning together with PEEP optimization, but her condition continued to deteriorate. 4 The patient was evaluated for rescue ECMO therapy as a life-saving measure. 5 Both femoral veins were cannulated, and when ECMO started, there was immediate improvement in oxygenation. The ventilator was soon switched to the pressure control setting (PEEP 10 cm H 2 O/inspiratory pressure 10 cm H 2 O/rate 10 cycles/min) with 40% FiO 2 . The patient's hospital stay was complicated by lupus-induced thrombocytopenia, resulting in our decision to run heparin-free ECMO. She was decannulated after 25 days of ECMO without receiving any systemic anticoagulation. Results: The patient improved and was decannulated, extubated, and discharged from hospital, with no residual lung comorbidity. Conclusions: ECMO without any systemic anticoagulation is an acceptable therapy when there is"

    "Data for this study came from a cohort of persons >18 years of age who were living in the New York City metropolitan area on September 11, 2001 . The cohort was recruited through a random digit dial telephone survey from March 25 through June 25, 2002. Contact information was obtained and follow-up interviews were conducted from September 25, 2002, through January 31, 2003, and from September 24, 2003, through February 29, 2004. Data regarding knowledge of, worry about, and attitudes toward AIDS and SARS were collected among a randomly selected subset of participants in the second cohort follow-up. The total sample included in this analysis, for whom data about AIDS, SARS, and social support were incomplete, consisted of 914 persons; response rate for eligible participants was 56%. Each participant received a $10 incentive. Additional details on sampling are provided elsewhere (5) . The Institutional Review Board of the New York Academy of Medicine reviewed and approved this study.",
    "Of the 914 participants, 45.4% were male, 54.1% white, 7.6% Asian or other race, 18.5% black, and 19.8% Hispanic ( Table 2 ). In multivariable models controlling for sociodemographic variables (online Appendix Table, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/5/825-appT.htm), persons with low or medium levels of social support were signifi cantly more likely than those with high levels of social support to report being poorly informed about AIDS (p = 0.004 for low support, p = 0.038 for medium support), being very worried about AIDS (p = 0.010 for medium support) and SARS (p = 0.010 for medium support), and to express more stigmatizing attitudes toward SARS (p = 0.020 for low support).",
    "The ability of public health institutions to effectively manage emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and mitigate their consequences is partly a function of public reaction to an epidemic. Negative reactions may vary from denial to panic to stigmatization. Denial or minimization of the threat of an EID by the population at risk can impede prevention efforts and increase transmission. Alternatively, an overreaction to the threat of an EID can overwhelm public health systems and resources, divert resources from effective disease control activities, and lead to severe economic losses in areas affected by the disease. Stigmatization can increase problems of persons with the disease and facilitate transmission because persons with or at risk for the disease may avoid seeking healthcare and because governments may attempt to suppress information about EIDs, considering their potentially severe economic consequences. From a public health policy perspective, identifying personal characteristics and resources that predict responses of persons to EIDs is important to improve the ability of the public to learn about, rationally appraise the threat of, and minimize stigmatization of EIDs.",
    "Determinants of a person's knowledge, worry, and stigma about EIDs are poorly understood. Although the quality of information conveyed to the public by various sources (e.g., healthcare providers, media) and epidemiologic characteristics of the disease (e.g., mode of transmis-sion, case fatality rate) are important, early empirical work suggests that responses to EIDs are infl uenced by characteristics that include a greater stock of personal resources. We recently reported that less education was associated with being poorly informed about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), very worried about AIDS, and having more stigmatizing attitudes toward AIDS and SARS (1, 2) . Social relationships may also be important. Helleringer et al. reported that social interactions among friends, peers, relatives, and community members may infl uence perceptions of HIV/AIDS risk and serve \"as a resource for individuals to learn about and evaluate new behavioral strategies in the face of the epidemic\" (3) ."

A recent and ongoing epidemic in the Indian Ocean area extended far beyond this region and caused hundreds of imported cases worldwide (2) (3) (4) . Chikungunya fever is diffi cult to clinically distinguish from co-endemic diseases such as malaria or dengue fever.

A quantifi ed CHIKV in vitro RNA transcript containing 9 \u00d7 10 10 subgenomic RNA copies/\u03bcL was used as a noninfectious positive control. Additional measures were taken to provide proper primers and probes because these components are most vulnerable to variation when assays are adapted from protocols, e.g., because of synthesis errors or poor purifi cation. Primers and probes were synthesized in large reference lots and stored centrally at an oligonucleotide factory. Samples of these lots were validated by the reference laboratory and confi rmed to provide full sensitivity as achieved with the original primers used in developing the prototype assay (3). Recipients of protocols were invited to order and use aliquots of primers directly from the validated reference lot."

    "O n March 5, 2003 , the first patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This index patient was a 78-year-old woman who, upon returning to Toronto from Hong Kong, transmitted the new variant coronavirus to her family (1). On March 7, her son was admitted to the hospital, and he subsequently died on March 13. His unrecognized disease led to nosocomial transmission of this disease in Toronto (1) . As of August 28, 2003, a total of 375 cases of suspected and probable SARS had been identified in Toronto; most of these cases occurred within healthcare facilities (1) (2) (3) . A minority of cases were related to household and community transmission, most acquired after hospital visits. The last community-acquired case of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection was identified on April 13, 2003 (2) .",
    "Physicians recruited to manage the outbreak included primary-care doctors, infectious diseases consultants, hospital epidemiologists, public health physicians, emergency department physicians, and radiologists.",
    "During the outbreak, Toronto hospitals developed standardized systems for all implicated procedures, including code blues, patient transfers, and other infection-control procedures.",
    "Specific standardized forms were developed, including emergency department SARS consult sheets that included all the appropriate key questions regarding exposure, date of onset of symptoms, specific symptoms, laboratory investigations, and chest x-ray findings; admission order forms, which allowed for standard orders for the nurses and MRPs (see Appendix, online only; available from: www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol10no5/03-0717_app.htm); and progress note forms, which documented symptoms, temperature, oxygen saturation and requirement, laboratory and x-ray results, and the daily plan. These documents both streamlined the process of daily review of 10 to 20 patients and standardized the level of care.",
    "The above-mentioned wards were considered SARS units, and the same engineering principles were applied to each. Each patient's room met the minimum requirement of six air changes per hour. Twice daily, the engineering department tested the negative-pressure status in all SARS units and patient rooms and presented the results to the hospital administration. In addition, an external company conducted daily assessments of the air circulation within the rooms. Highly trained engineering staff and clear blueprints and plans of the facility's ventilation system were needed to implement all the required changes.",

Disaster planners are challenged to develop a global perspective, including accurate communication of events as they unfold in distant jurisdictions. As a result, links to colleagues locally, nationally and internationally are vital in a disaster situation.",

    "PRED BALB/c is a computational system that predicts peptides binding to the major histocompatibility complex-2 (H2 d ) of the BALB/c mouse, an important laboratory model organism. The predictions include the complete set of H2 d class I (H2-K d , H2-L d and H2-D d ) and class II (I-E d and I-A d ) molecules. The prediction system utilizes quantitative matrices, which were rigorously validated using experimentally determined binders and non-binders and also by in vivo studies using viral proteins. The prediction performance of PRED BALB/c is of very high accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first online server for the prediction of peptides binding to a complete set of major histocompatibility complex molecules in a model organism (H2 d haplotype). PRED BALB/c is available at http://antigen.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/predBalbc/.",
    "CONCLUSION PRED BALB/c marks a new direction in predictive modeling of MHC-binding peptides and T-cell epitopes. The main advantage is that PRED BALB/c focuses on a complete organism and its predictions represent a complete set of predicted targets of T-cell immune responses. The focus on the complete set of MHC alleles is closer to studies involving laboratory animals. This approach provides a more complete view of the immune responses of an organism. The BALB/c mouse is an important laboratory model and PRED BALB/c is, therefore, useful for the analysis of immunization regimens and deciphering responses to infections. Further development of PRED BALB/c will include addition of matrices for prediction of 8mer and 10mer binders to H2 d class I molecules and further improvement of prediction matrices by cyclical refinement-using newly defined binders and non-binders from experiments.",
    "Five 9 \u00b7 20 matrices were built, one for each of the five H2 d alleles, and 10-fold cross-validations were performed to test the accuracy of the prediction models. The results show that PRED BALB/c predicts peptides binding to I-E d , I-A d and H2-K d with excellent accuracy [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, A ROC > 0.90], and to H2-D d and H2-L d with good accuracy (A ROC > 0.85). The models were also rigorously tested using experimentally known peptides from viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic origins (14, (26) (27) (28) (29) and validated by in vivo studies using severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nucleocapsid and HIV GAG proteins. The H2 d models accurately predicted 11 out of 12 ELISPOT positive regions from BALB/c mice splenocytes immunized with SARS nucleocapsid DNA vaccines (data not shown). The web interface of PRED BALB/c uses a set of graphical user interface forms. The interface was built using a combination of Perl, CGI and C programs. PRED BALB/c has been implemented in a SunOS 5.9 UNIX environment."

    "Microarry-based analyses have been well established and are currently used in a wide range of biological assays (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Extrapolation of their use for infectious diagnostics and detection of biodefense related agents provides an attractive alternative to conventional analytical approaches. Hence the critical need for advanced diagnostic systems in microbiology is to detect rapidly genetic information within the known and unanticipated pathogenic microrganisms associated with the human health (i.e. viruses, bacteria and fungi). With the parallelism offered by DNA microarray technology we are able to pursue and develop an approach to large-scale analyses of such abundance of genetic information in these organisms. The main technical challenge in this field arises from the difficulty in labeling sufficient copies of pathogenic biomarkers. However, when integrated in one portable diagnostic device labelfree detection has great potential for addressing this neckbottle and speeds up practical application of microarray technology.",

    "The high mutation rate of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virus is a major problem since it evades the function of antibodies and chemical inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate a viral detection strategy based on synthetic biology principles to detect a specific viral function rather than a particular viral protein. The resistance caused by mutations can be circumvented since the mutations that cause the loss of function also incapacitate the virus. Many pathogens encode proteases that are essential for their replication and that have a defined substrate specificity. A genetically encoded sensor composed of a fused membrane anchor, viral protease target site, and an orthogonal transcriptional activator was engineered into a human cell line. The HIV-1 protease released the transcriptional activator from the membrane, thereby inducing transcription of the selected genes. The device was still strongly activated by clinically relevant protease mutants that are resistant to protease inhibitors. In the future, a similar principle could be applied to detect also other pathogens and functions.",
    "The principle behind the genetically encoded device for the detection of the viral protease activity is based on the proteolytic cleavage of the peptide linker, which links the orthogonal transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 to the membrane anchor. The viral presence (specifically the viral protease activity) is sensed by the irreversible proteolytic step, which causes the release of the transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 from the membrane and activation of the selected transcriptional response. The Gal4-VP16 activator, therefore, exists in two states: an inactive state, where the transcriptional activator is located at the membrane and where it cannot bind to the respective operator site, and an active state, where the Gal4-VP16 is translocated into the nucleus where it can bind to and activate the selected effector gene (e.g., reporter or human IFN-\u03b21).",
    "We demonstrated the sensing and transcriptional activation of the device using a luciferase reporter assay, with which we measured the expression of the luciferase gene induced by the transcriptional activator, Gal4-VP16. The transcriptional activity of Gal4-VP16 was triggered by the cleavage of the linker to the transmembrane receptor by the HIV-1 protease, which released Gal4-VP16 into the nucleus and activated the transcription of the luciferase under the control of the Gal4responsive operator. The luciferase activity was observed only in cells cotransfected with the HIV-1 genome, and the plasmid for CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 (Supporting Information Figure S2a ) or FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 (Supporting Information Figure S2b ). Synthetic HIV-1 protease inhibitors inhibited the activation of Gal4-VP16, as in the presence of 5 \u03bcM SAQ or 5 \u03bcM ritonavir (RTV), activation of the reporter was reduced by more than 70% for CD4(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 (Supporting Information Figure S2a ) and more than 90% for FAS(HA)-hivp-GAL4-VP16 (Supporting Information Figure S2b) ."

    "E merging diseases are frequently zoonoses caused by RNA viruses (1, 2) . Defense against emerging infectious diseases, identifi cation of reservoirs for such viruses, surveillance for host-jumping events, and elucidation of viral and host factors that may facilitate such events are warranted. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was caused by a newly emerged zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus). Other coronaviruses have also jumped to new host species and caused emerging diseases. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus emerged in European pigs from an unknown host species during the late 1970s and caused severe enteric disease (3) . Human coronavirus OC43 is believed to have been derived from bovine coronavirus (4) . In addition, the genomes of canine and feline coronaviruses can recombine in vivo and have developed into different biotypes that are serially transmissible in their new host species (5) .",

    "The tools for combating malaria (insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor residual spraying of insecticide, artemisinin-based combination therapies, and intermittent preventive therapy for pregnant women) need further scaleup, but such tools are susceptible to development of resistance on the part of the vector or parasite, and evidence is accumulating that nets may be less durable than assumed (26, 29) .

    "The second decade of this century has been designated as the decade of vaccines (33) . The opportunity exists for a notable effect on the 2.5 million deaths of children annually from vaccine-preventable diseases, including through use of new vaccines for prevention of rotavirus and pneumococcal infection, and by strengthening routine services. Vaccination against type A meningococcal meningitis in the Sahel and against hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus illustrate the unrivaled possibilities in terms of controlling previously deadly epidemics or virus-induced cancers. A major unfinished priority is polio eradication; this goal is particularly threatened by funding shortfalls and ongoing transmission in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria, which have seeded infection in other countries in which polio had been eliminated (34) .",
    "Equity, universal health coverage and access, and fairness in health financing are global aspirations likely to feature prominently in discussions about what comes after the 2015 MDG target date. The unfinished infectious disease agenda will remain a priority, but common approaches will have to address noncommunicable diseases, regulation of commerce in medical technologies and pharmaceuticals, health financing, and systems strengthening. An emerging topic will be surveillance for and mitigation of effects of environmental and climate change."

In addition to these new threats, public health officials face a large number of disease outbreaks every year in hospitals, schools, and other small communities.

Assuming SARS dynamics in Beijing would follow a similar pattern, we used the Richards model to predict that the SARS epidemic in Beijing would end by late June 2003.

    "A separate study was done to examine the associations between psychosocial factors (stress, social support, fl uctuations in mood) and viral exacerbations of asthma. The study involved naturally occurring illnesses rather than experimentally-induced infections but it maintained several important features of the methodology used by Cohen and colleagues. 21, 24 For example, stress was measured at the start of the study by measuring the immune responses in terms of leukocytes present in peripheral blood in order to determine the extent to which stress could predict subsequent illness. In addition, effects of personality, 25 smoking status, and alcohol consumption 21 were also studied as possible predictors of susceptibility to respiratory viral infections.",
    "From the preceding discussion it is clear that stress can be defi ned in many different ways depending upon the objectives or perspective of the researcher. All these defi nitions, however, share a common component of adaptive physiological responses following challenges to homeostasis. The adaptive reactions to stressors may involve mobilization of a wide variety of physiological responses including the immune response. Stress responses usually include physical perturbations that can encompass either the entire body or specifi c cellular compartments. Considering the volume of work in various areas of stressors and their effects the main objective of the current review is to focus on one type of stress, which includes psychological stressors.",
    "While it has been assumed that psychological (psychogenic) and physical (neurogenic) stressors are most closely aligned with depression, the suspicion has arisen that systemic stressors, including immune alterations, may also act in such a provocative capacity. 35 Communication occurs between the immune, endocrine, autonomic and central nervous systems 36 such that psychological events that affect central neurochemical processes may affect immune activity. Conversely, immune activation may affect hormonal processes and the activity of central neurotransmitters. Thus, by virtue of the neurochemical effects imparted, immune activation may affect behavioral outputs and may even be related to behavioral pathology such as depressive illness. 37 The hypothesis that altered immune activation may occur as a result of various stressors emerged over time. The initial theory came from Hans Seyles' GAS, which was derived from observation and experimentation on laboratory animals. Using a variety of stressors (ie, pain, thermal extremes and starvation), Seyle described a common nonspecifi c stress response pathway. 38 After initial perception of a stressor, the animal mounts an emergency alarm or fi ght-or-fl ight response. This catecholamine-driven reaction results in increased cardiovascular function and an overall increase in metabolism. If the stressor persists, the resistance phase or 'conservation withdrawal reaction' is initiated, which is a physiological coping reaction to the increased demands of maintaining homeostasis. Chronic stress leads to the exhaustion phase and may lead to pathology. Seyle's theory unifi ed the stress phenomena because it provided a common response pathway to all the varied stressors encountered."

    "We have initiated a drug-discovery strategy to identify ''druggable,'' efficacious anti-filovirus PMOs. This proof-ofprinciple study using PMOs demonstrates favorable anti-EBOV activity both in vitro and in vivo; thus, these molecules represent a pool of potential lead compounds for further evaluation and optimization. Future studies will focus on determining the most favorable PMO dose and regimen and also the therapeutic potential of these molecules. Additionally, antisense PMO designed to target other regions within the EBOV genome will be pursued. Genetically designed microbial therapeutics, such as antisense PMOs or other sequence-based approaches, allow quick hit-to-lead optimization and may accelerate time-to-drug development. Together, these strategies could result in a highly efficacious therapeutic treatment regimen for lethal viral infections. Nucleotide-based antivirals, such as PMOs, can be easily produced in large quantities, have already been tested in human clinical trials, and have appropriate safety profiles for use with humans [34] . The results presented here have farreaching implications for the treatment of highly lethal hemorrhagic fever viruses, and for diseases caused by many other acute viral diseases including SARS, influenza, and dengue, or other emerging pathogens."

    "Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense RNA viruses. Viruses in the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus are associated with mammals and show a particularly high level of diversification in bats. Viruses in the genera Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus are mostly avian-associated viruses (6, 7) . MERS-CoV belongs to Betacoronavirus phylogenetic lineage C that, in addition to MERS-CoV, contains 2 distinct bat-associated CoV species (HKU4 and HKU5) (1, 8) .",
    "Transmission patterns, including the putative zoonotic source of the virus, remain unclear. Hypotheses include frequent zoonotic infections with limited subsequent human-to-human transmission chains and existence of a self-sustained epidemic in humans (4) . A recent study found evidence to support the existence of epidemiologically unlinked cases in a large outbreak in the al-Hasa region, Saudi Arabia (5) . It was speculated that zoonotic introductions of MERS-CoV from an unknown reservoir might occur at high rates, in addition to obvious human-tohuman transmission."

    "In the final stage of emergence, increased travel or migration facilitate the global spread of new zoonoses. For example, increased movements between villages or cities and higher between-person contact rates through increased numbers of sexual partners appear to have facilitated the early emergence of HIV/AIDS in Africa (12) . This disease became a global pandemic following the expansion of road networks, changes in workforce demography, and increases in international air travel to central Africa and globally (12, 23) .",
    "Hunting of wildlife by humans is an ancient practice that carries a substantial risk for cross-species transmission. Despite the discovery of cooking \u22481.9 million years ago (9), the risk of zoonotic diseases emerging from hunting and eating wildlife is still of global importance because of increases in human population density, globalized trade, and consequent increased contact between humans and animals.",
    "Research in medical anthropology has begun to examine indigenous theories of infectious disease (15) and the cultural contexts within which diseases emerge (16), but little data exist on local perceptions of health or other risks associated with hunting and eating bushmeat. Humans as well as other animals employ behavioral adaptations to avoid exposure to infections, yet the type of protective strategies that hunters might use and the effectiveness of such strategies remain unknown. For this reason, anthropologic studies of bushmeat should include not only the details of hunting, but also the transportation of meat to the village, the market, the kitchen, and onto the table. These practices are often articulated along lines of gender and ethnicity and within cultural contexts.",
    "Different activities associated with bushmeat trade will involve different levels of risk for microbial emergence. Hunting (tracking, capturing, handling, sometimes basic field butchering, and transporting of the carcass) involves contact with potentially infected vectors, whereas distant consumption may not. Particularly high risks may be associated with hunting nonhuman primates, and even greater risks in hunting species such as chimpanzee, which are phylogenetically closest to humans. Butchering (opening, cutting, dressing, and preparing the carcass) is obviously more high risk for bloodborne pathogens than the transportation, sale, purchase, and eating of the butchered meat."

    "To obtain DNA for genotyping, a 10-\u03bcm section from blocks containing formalin-fi xed, paraffi n-embedded tissues was deparaffi nized with xylene and washed twice with absolute ethanol. After residual ethanol evaporated, tissues were digested overnight at 56\u00b0C in 200 \u03bcL Buffer PKD with 20 \u03bcL proteinase K (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Extraction of the supernatant was completed with an EZ1 DNA Tissue Kit or a MagAttract DNA Mini M48 Kit (QIAGEN), with DNA eluted into a fi nal 100-\u03bcL volume. DNA quality was assessed with a human RNase P real-time PCR in 25-\u03bcL volumes by using Agilent Brilliant II QPCR Master Mix as described (4) . Validated TaqMan assays were used to genotype each SNP (protocols, primers, and probes available at http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov). Each 25-\u03bcL real-time PCR consisted of 12.5 \u03bcL of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 900 nmol of assay-specifi c primer, 200 nmol of assay-specifi c probe, and 5 \u03bcL of DNA. All controls (extraction blanks, no template controls, and positive controls for each genotype used at 5 ng per PCR; Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ, USA) and unknown samples were assayed in duplicate. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and 50 cycles of 92\u00b0C for 30 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min.

Pandemic containment has not been a priority to date and may not be feasible."

Initially, small crusts suspected to be associated with flea allergy and pyoderma were present; however, response was poor to multiple treatments, including repeated corticosteroid therapy and antimicrobial therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and enrofloxacin. The owner reported having skin abscesses and pneumonia 3 months earlier, although no microbiologic testing was performed.",
    "Cytologic evaluation of exudate from the cat's lesions identified neutrophils and eosinophils with engulfed cocci. Leukocytosis with eosinophilia was found on a complete blood cell count. No notable abnormalities were present on thoracic radiograph, abdominal ultrasonograph, urinalysis, and tests for feline leukemia and immunodeficiency virus. Skin biopsy specimens were collected for histologic examination, and swabs of the exudates were submitted for bacterial culture. Histopathologic findings demonstrated ulcers and dermal granulation tissue with linearly arranged eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, and plasma cells between dense, homogeneous collagen bundles (sclerosing dermatitis). This pattern of inflammation is distinct from most staphylococcal infections of the skin, and it has been suggested that this uncommon histologic finding in cats is associated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infection (1) ."

Each group was further divided into subgroups (families) to test whether biases existed in numbers of emerging and reemerging species at this level. The viruses were also divided according to genome type (e.g., negative singlestranded RNA viruses).",

However, we comment on the transmissibility of pathogens once they have been introduced into the human population because transmissibility is an important determinant of the potential public health problem.",

    "Evidence is steadily mounting that the coronaviruses are of major importance in common respiratory infection of all age groups, especially those occurring in midwinter and early spring. The total impact of coronavirus infections on the general population cannot be calculated at present because not all viral types have been identified. Only 229E and OC43 are amenable to large scale serologic studies; iniection rates for other distinct types such as OC16, cannot be determined. The assumption must be made that the former two types are typical of the other viruses.",
    "It is premature at present to think in terms of control of coronavirus infection. Not all viral types have been identified and some known agents cannot be easily propagated in the laboratory. Thus, preparation of vaccines of the conventional types is impossible. The frequency of reinfection observed with these agents is so high that control by vaccination may not be practical, but it is possible that further studies may allow identification of truly protective antibodies. There remains environmental control of infection; such efforts have only rarely been useful for other respiratory agents and they are likely not to be more efficacious for the coronaviruses (43)."

    "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a leading cause of death of feedlot cattle in the USA. Annual costs associated with BRD total more than one billion dollars. Environmental stress, compromised host immunity, and virus infection predispose the animal to bacterial lung infection (broncho-pneumonia). 1 Primary virus infections damage the respiratory tract and subdue the host immune system. The respiratory tract commensal bacteria cause opportunistic secondary infections and lung pneumonia under immunecompromised conditions (caused by viral infection and other factors). In fact, previous studies have reported bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus, and bovine coronavirus from cattle with BRD. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although more than 40 years ago, studies concluded that bovine rhinitis viruses (BRVs) (then known as bovine rhinoviruses) cause mild respiratory disease in cattle, [7] [8] [9] [10] it is a surprise that BRVs are sparsely studied. This is partly due to the fact that the virus grows poorly in cell culture and is known to cause only selflimiting mild respiratory illness.",
    "The findings of these algorithms (Tables 3 and 4 ) for the assessment of recombination potential are consistent with other published studies regarding the potential of Picornavirus genomes to undergo recombination events. 34 We concluded based on these findings and what was previously described in the existing literature that the likelihood of detecting recombination events between FMDV and BRV could be described as highly remote. We also inferred that given the absence of prior exchanges between the genomes with two different sample pools, the chance of future exchanges would be novel and highly unlikely.",
    "This study details new and important genomic information regarding Aphthoviruses in general and specifically, we report a new member of the bovine rhinoviruses, which is BRAV. Several bioinformatics tools employed in this study help to elucidate the molecular diversity of Aphthoviruses, and help to distinguish BRAV from other members of the virus lineage. The knowledge gleaned herein and the applications of these bioinformatics tools will assist other researchers to investigate novel viral pathogens."

    "In general, owing to the multiple functions of USP18 and its expression in various cell types, it would be complicated to generate one drug that can be used to treat all the diseases in which USP18 is involved. We believe that this difficulty can be resolved by using targeted drug delivery. Such technology would be the best strategy to overcome the protein's wide expression and will allow recovery from various types of immunological dysfunctions.",
    "In humans, two isoforms of USP18 have been described. 12 They differ in their N-terminal region because of translation from a non-canonical rare start codon CUG; this translation produces a full-length protein or a canonical start codon, AUG, and results in the N-terminal truncated isoform USP18-sf. Although USP18 is mainly located in the cytoplasm, USP18-sf is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Both proteins maintain their functional activity in term of enzymatic and IFNAR2 binding ability, but the USP18-sf isoform is the main delSGylation enzyme for nuclear proteins and therefore may serve cell-specific functions. In addition, because USP18-sf is controlled by two independent mechanisms, its regulation is more flexible. Additional studies are needed to characterize the role of each isoform and to determine whether the regulation pathway can influence the outcome of USP18 function. 12",
    "Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) is known as an ISG15 isopeptidase and a negative regulator of type I and type III interferon signaling. 1, 2 The Usp18 gene was originally called Ubp43 because it encodes a 43-kDa protein homologous with ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs). It was first cloned by Liu et al. 3, 4 from mice expressing the leukemia fusion protein AML1-ETO and later by other groups from virus-infected porcine alveolar macrophages 5 and human melanoma cell lines. 6 The gene and protein were renamed Usp18 and USP18, respectively, according to the systematic nomenclature suggested by Baker et al. 7 for UBPs and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins. On the basis of its amino-acid sequence, USP18 is a member of the USP family, which is responsible for removing ubiquitin or Ubl proteins from their conjugated substrates."

This syndrome was first recognized in February 2003 in Vietnam, but it was later realized that the first cases occurred in southern China in November 2002 (6, 7) .

    "To the Editor: Malaria continues to cause disease and death in millions of persons living in areas of the world where it is endemic, despite 4 decades of research on vaccines, new drugs, and alternative methods of control. Still, by far the most effective method for reducing and controlling the impact of this disease is indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides. The most cost-effective and safe insecticide has been, and in many instances still is, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). This intervention is continually under scrutiny, and we address these issues in this letter.",
    "Our study was limited by sample size and its retrospective status. Nonetheless, we demonstrated the accuracy of diagnostic criteria in an outbreak and the importance of epidemiologic criteria. Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these criteria in a nonoutbreak situation when the case prevalence is low. ",

    "Diverse coronaviruses have been identifi ed in bats from several continents but not from Africa. We identifi ed group 1 and 2 coronaviruses in bats in Kenya, including SARS-related coronaviruses. The sequence diversity suggests that bats are well-established reservoirs for and likely sources of coronaviruses for many species, including humans.",
    "These data demonstrate that the CoV diversity in bats previously detected in Asia, Europe, and North America is also present, possibly to a greater extent, in Africa. The extent of this diversity among CoVs may be shown more clearly through additional studies in bats, and increased demonstration of CoV diversity in bats may require a reconsideration of how they should be grouped. The frequency and diversity of CoV detections in bats, now in multiple continents, demonstrate that bats are likely an important source for introduction into other species globally. Understanding the extent and diversity of CoV infection in bats provides a foundation for detecting new disease introductions that may, like SARS, present a public health threat.",
    "Of 221 bat fecal swabs examined, 41 (19%) were positive by at least 1 of the 2 seminested RT-PCR assays (Table) . One specimen had 2 distinct CoV sequences, each amplifi ed by 1 of the 2 PCR assays, giving a total of 42 distinct CoV sequences. To characterize the overall diversity of CoV sequences, in this study a phylogenetic tree (Figure 2 ) of the 121-bp fragment of RdRp was generated from 39 coronaviruses from bats in Kenya and 47 selected human and animal coronaviruses from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database based on the Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain method (14) . Three of the 42 sequences were not of suffi ciently high quality to include in this tree. Some nodes had low Bayesian posterior probabilities ( Figure 2 ). Longer sequences from these viruses are needed to refi ne their phylogenetic relationships."

    "SARS is predominantly a respiratory infection, which possibly spreads through the mucosal lumen or the bloodstream to extrapulmonary sites where viral replication leads to nonrespiratory manifestations. Concomitant immune dysregulation and associated inflammatory damage could accentuate disease progression and death. High viral load in NPA, with or without high viral load in serum, is a useful prognostic indicator of respiratory failure or death. The presence of viral RNA in multiple body sites also indicates poor prognosis. Early treatment with an effective antiviral agent before day 10 may decrease the peak viral load, ameliorate symptoms, and improve outcome; early treatment may also reduce viral shedding and thus the risk for transmission."

    "The emergence of infectious diseases is a major threat to global public health in this century (WHO, World Health Report http://www.who.int/whr/previous/en/index.html) and many of these new infectious human diseases are caused by viruses emerging from wildlife. In the last 50 years, more than 30 new infectious human diseases have been identified (WHO, World Health Report http://www.who.int/whr/previous/en/index.html) including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The aetiological agent of this disease was identified as a previously unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] and BatCoV are putative precursors of SARS-CoV [2] . The outbreak of SARS-CoV and subsequent identification of two additional human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 [3] and HCoV-HKU1 [4] ) has drawn human and animal health attention to Coronavirinae subfamily, that includes three genera, Alphacoronavirus (a CoV), Betacoronavirus (b CoV) and Gammacoronavirus (c CoV), replacing the classical groups 1, 2 and 3 [5] (http://talk.ictvonline.org/ media/g/vertebrate-2008/default.aspx).",
    "To determine the presence and distribution of putative zoonotic CoV in Iberian bats, 576 individuals from 26 bat species were captured and sampled in 13 different locations throughout Spain during 2004-2007 (Fig. 1) . These samples were collected in the context of bat rhabdoviruses and lyssaviruses Surveillance Program in Spain. Most of the sampled bat species are also distributed across Europe, but Eptesicus isabellinus is a meridional serotine bat restricted to North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula [23] , and Myotis escalerai is endemic in the Iberian Peninsula. Bats were caught with mist nets mainly as they left diurnal roost and by hand with polyethylene butterfly nets within roosts. Oro-pharyngeal swabs (n=390) between 2004 and 2007 as well as faecal samples from individual bats (n=216) in 2007 were taken before bats were released (Table 1) .",
    "In conclusion, previous studies showed the presence of BatCoV in Europe. However, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the presence of CoV RNA in Iberian bat species. Phylogenetic data indicate high diversity, wide distribution and complex ecology of CoV in bats captured in diverse Spanish locations. The sequences reported herein provide new insights into the diversity of coronaviruses and describe new phylogenetic linages that appear to diverge from all genotypes previously detected in other European locations. Future studies should clarify whether such apparently high diversity reflects the bio-geographical peculiarities of the Iberian Peninsula or not. This study contributes with a new dataset to the global surveillance of emerging BatCoV with pathogenic potential in humans. Our data reinforce the notion that the ecology and transmission of CoV in bat reservoirs is far from being completely understood and that more studies will be necessary to evaluate the magnitude of the potential threat that these viruses pose to human health."

    "The common cold is a profound nuisance in everyday life, although seldom a cause of serious illness. The average child can expect to have four to eight episodes per year, and adults three to five infections. Many viruses, such as parainfluenza, RSV, and coronavirus, can produce similar symptoms, but rhinovirus is by far the most frequent etiologic agent. Repeated colds are virtually guaranteed because there are >100 distinct rhinovirus serotypes, and infection with one serotype does not confer substantial immunity against the others.",
    "Influenza is a substantial threat to hospitalized patients despite the availability of a relatively effective vaccine and two classes of drugs (M2 ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors) shown to prevent infection in clinical trials (24) . Although influenza is widely viewed as affecting primarily elderly patients and adults with coexisting illnesses or conditions, such as chronic pulmonary and cardiac disease, nosocomial transmission has been well documented in young children (25, 26) . Perhaps nosocomial disease is less frequently diagnosed in hospitalized children because infants are unable to articulate many of influenza's characteristic symptoms, and influenza often presents simply as an episode of fever in this population."

    "As discussed above, the majority of high-throughput data to emerge from the biodefense field has been microarray mRNA expression data, rather than from high-throughput protein interaction data that directly lend itself to network analysis. However, genomics-and proteomics-level analyses have produced interaction networks that are beginning to yield some consistent and overlapping signaling pathways across different model systems, and novel computational approaches are providing alternative strategies for virus comparison and attenuation.",
    "As new viruses continue to emerge and the risks from emerging and remerging pathogens remain, the need for vaccines against these pathogens remains significant. The introduction and spread of West Nile virus to North America illustrates how quickly viruses can become established in a new area and present novel threats to public health [75] . The continuing investment in biodefense and emerging pathogens will result in even greater amounts of basic data to input into novel bioinformatics tools. As our understanding of the molecular determinants of protection and pathogenesis continues to grow, the development of safe, effective vaccines to these important pathogens will continue to accelerate.",
    "The use of global approaches, particularly microarray gene expression technology, has provided a wealth of information detailing the host responses to infection. While these data are often limited to transcription rather than expression at the protein level, they have provided significant insight into which classes of host genes are up-and downregulated in response to virus infections. A novel application of this technology is to use the differentially expressed genes as a marker of upstream transcription factor activation using bioinformatics tools such as CARRIE [24, 25] . In this way, host signaling pathways activated or repressed by virus infection can be inferred and studied further, in particular those inhibited by virus-induced proteins that are critical in the pathogenesis of the virus (see below).",
    "However, all of the current biothreat viruses, with the exception of Variola virus, are RNA viruses, with limited coding capacity and proteins that have multiple functions. In these cases, the deletion of entire genes may result in a nonviable virus. This illustrates the importance of identifying the individual residues/regions responsible for specific virushost interactions. If specific residues are identified that are important in determining virulence or in modulating the host immune response, but do not interfere in the critical functions of viral replication, mutation of these sites may lead to novel vaccine candidates. For example, recent mapping of the Nipah virus P gene has identified a region that is required for inhibition of STAT-1 signaling, but without disrupting its function as a cofactor for the viral polymerase [23] ."

    "Phylogeography, an emerging discipline in public health, allows researchers to model the evolution and migration patterns of viruses, and can be an especially useful tool for studying rapidly evolving viruses like RNA viruses [1] .

Without any handcrafted features, the authors' classifier achieved better performances than state-of-the-art systems on two well-known corpora. These results were confirmed in [19] , among other publications."

    "As an epidemic declines, the doubling time increases. Variation in doubling time among countries probably arises from variation in both transmission rates and control efforts ( Figure 3 ). Transmission rate (with units of time -1 ) is determined by the expected number of susceptible persons with whom each infectious person comes into contact during a time unit in their infectious periods and by the probability of disease transmission per contact. High-density population centers, crowded public transportation systems, and hospital waiting rooms increase the number of contacts, while personal hygiene affects the probability that transmission will occur with each contact. In all countries, seasonal effects may also play a substantial role with the virus spreading faster in winter.",
    "Estimates of CFR may change as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays become more widely used in diagnosis (5) . Diagnostic tests could identify mild cases that currently are not reported. Our estimate of the size of the epidemic would then increase in terms of number of cases, but the estimates of CFR would decrease. Conversely, PCR tests might eliminate the diagnosis of SARS in some suspected cases. Ultimately, accurate estimates of population distributions of parameters reflecting the clinical course of disease will be best provided by follow-up of clearly defined cohorts of infected persons identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures."

    "We first focused on the simple issue of what percentage of all sequences are unique within a series of model genomes. This uniqueness measure is directly linked to the effect of read length on re-sequencing, where sequence information is assembled on a known template. In its simplest form, resequencing requires that a probe is uniquely identifiable with a single location on the template sequence.",
    "As more complete genome sequences become available the quality of map information will increase. However it is not currently clear how reliable much of this information is, nor how best to apply it to the problem of reassembly from very short reads. We have therefore restricted our analysis to reassemble with no additional mapping information. In this analysis we use a suffix array to examine all possible fragments of a given size and use this information to predict which contigs could be assembled.",
    "Such a length is beyond the reach of sequencing by hybridization as selectivity for single mismatches will not be possible (12) . Single molecule (23) and sequencing by synthesis approaches currently claim read lengths of 25 to 115 nt 10 and therefore the application of the techniques to whole human genome re-sequencing shows promise."

Repeat systemic dose-escalation studies of naked PMO and 2\u2032-OMe/PS oligonucleotides having been completed recently in DMD patients and further doseescalations studies planned 37, 167 (current trials reviews in ref. 168) , while recruitment for a clinical trial to treat spinal muscular atrophy is underway (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01494701), which is another neuromuscular disease where peptide-conjugated PMO is likely to be applied.",
    "An interesting new application is the use of triplex-forming PNA conjugated with the classic CPP Penetratin to direct gene modification in the hematopoietic stem cells of mice, retaining unmodified differentiation capabilities. 16 Sequencespecific gene modification was also observed in multiple somatic tissues following systemic administration, and also preserved in bone marrow and spleen of recipient mice following transplantation of bone marrow from Penetratin-PNA-treated mice. This suggests that peptide-PNA conjugates might have good potential application for treatment of monogenic hematological diseases such as thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.",
    "Most of the anti-miR oligonucleotide types utilize 2\u2032-OMe, LNA or 2\u2032-fluoro analogues usually as mixmers of more than one analogue type or with DNA ( Table 3 ). In vivo applications all utilize PS linkages. Currently, there are no papers describing peptide delivery of such anti-miRs. As discussed above, it seems that some naked oligonucleotide analogues may have the ability not only to enter cells through endocystosis but also can efficiently block miRNA activity without need for any enhancement of transfection by peptide or other vectors. 19, 20, 35, 82, 83 Thus it seems unlikely that peptidemediated delivery will be of value for such oligonucleotide types."

    "Animal and tissue samples Male Fischer 344 rats (Harlen Sprague Dawley, Inc, Indianapolis, IN), weighing 140-150 g at the beginning of the experiments, were used. The basal diet was obtained from Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA. BR931 (LPB Instituto Farmaceutica S.P.A., Milan, Italy) and BR931 was incorporated in the basal diet at a concentration of 0.16%. Water was supplied ad libitum. On days 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 after feeding of the designated diets was started, rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their livers were removed, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70'C. After long term feeding of BR931, approximately 8-9 months, hepatic tumours and normal-adjacent livers were quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70\u00b0C. RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis Frozen liver tissues were homogenised in guanidine monothiocyanate, using a Polytron homogeniser (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY), and total RNA was isolated by the method of Chirgwin et al.

    "Climate change also effects evolution of pathogens, and where relevant, their vectors. Continual mutation and recombination events give rise to variants with altered levels of fi tness to persist and spread. Changing ecologic circumstances and pathogen diversity can give rise to variants with altered pathogenic potential. However, the host must not be ignored. Increased longevity and therapies for persons with diseases can modulate host susceptibility and concomitant infections and upset the evolving and dynamic infection balance.",
    "Zoonotic pathogens from wildlife may infect humans with little or no human-to-human transmission (e.g., avian infl uenza virus and Hendra virus). Alternatively, increased travel or migration and increased between-person contacts have facilitated emergence of simian immunodefi ciency virus/HIV/AIDS in Africa. Increased exposure to wildcaught animals and high mutation rates of many RNA viruses have increased their predominance among emerging zoonoses transmitted from human to human; RNA viruses from bush meat may therefore play a possible role in future disease emergence."

A dialogue participant also discussed the tremendous economic impact of the outbreak of Nipah virus infection in Malaysia during 1998-1999, which resulted in the culling of >1 million pigs, essentially shuttering the pork industry of this nation and exerting a tremendous economic toll (6) ."

    "H epatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded positivesense RNA virus that belongs to the family Hepeviridae, genus Hepevirus, and is the causative agent of hepatitis E (1, 2) . Because the transmission of HEV from deer, swine, and wild boars to humans is well known, hepatitis E is recognized as a zoonosis. Zoonotic hepatitis E is associated mainly with genotype 3 (G3) and G4 HEV infection (3, 4) . In addition to deer, swine, and wild boars, other animals, including monkeys, rats, ferrets, chickens, and bats, harbor HEV or HEV-like viruses (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .

    "Ferret HEV was also recently detected in the United States in serum (11) , suggesting that ferret HEV infection is not restricted to the Netherlands and might be distributed in ferrets worldwide. Because ferrets are susceptible to several respiratory viruses, including human and avian influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (12, 13) , ferrets have been used as a small-animal model for these viruses. Ferrets are also kept as pets in many countries. Thus, information about ferret HEV epidemiology, distribution, transmission, and pathogenesis is urgently needed."

Most of the ferrets were brought to veterinarians for clinical signs such as diarrhea, abdominal masses, and hypergammaglobulinemia; some had signs unrelated to coronavirus infection or were asymptomatic ( Table 1 ). The diarrhea tended to be mild, unlike with ECE, and was found in coronavirus-negative and -positive animals.",

Five (35.7%) specimens were positive (data not shown), providing a route leading to infection of susceptible animals. Coronaviruses are known to cause both respiratory and intestinal diseases in various animal species; therefore, ferret coronaviruses should be investigated in respiratory disease."

    "Other recent events may offer insight into the desirability of using medical students as volunteers. Anecdotes from the terrorist attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001 , relate how medical students helped in various capacities immediately following the tragedy (10). However, no offi cial school or government mandate was issued forcing these persons to volunteer. In contrast, after the devastation of Hurricane Rita, college leaders at Texas A&M University College of Medicine made a decision to cancel classes and provided orientation sessions for students so that they could begin volunteering as soon as possible (11) . Volunteer tasks in this situation were limited, and many voiced frustration that their relatively limited medical skills greatly restricted their ability to contribute. In a more positive vein, students also claimed that \"the experience made them even more driven to become the best doctors they can\" (11) .",

Health Canada predicts that 4.5-10.6 million Canadians will become clinically ill and 11,000-58,000 will die in such an event (1) . The current strain of infl uenza A (H5N1), which has been circulating in Southeast Asia among birds, with limited spread to humans, has fueled this concern (2,3). An infl uenza pandemic would cause a shortage of healthcare professionals due to illness and an increased demand for their services (1) . Consequently, Canada and other countries have begun developing plans to deal with the anticipated health crisis (1) , and medical students could play an important role.",

Although medical students obtained health information from varying sources, they had the highest degree of confi dence in the information provided by physicians.",
    "Preventive measures are important not just during a pandemic, but at all times to decrease the risk of transmission of bacterial and viral illnesses. Most medical students (93.5% and 81.6%, respectively) correctly identifi ed hand washing and cough etiquette, respectively, as effective preventive measures (it is important to note, however, that there is a difference between students knowing and complying). Social distancing can help reduce the peak incidence of an epidemic and spread it over several weeks instead of a few, thus avoiding a healthcare surge (6) . Household quarantine is also effective at reducing attack rates in the community but only if the compliance rate is high (7) . Knowledge regarding treatment of pandemic infl uenza is diffi cult to analyze because determining what measures would be effective is complex. Given the time lag between identifi cation of the pandemic strain and the time needed to produce a vaccine, any known treatment strategy would not be effective unless it could be applied to the strain that is causing the pandemic."

    "Environmental conditions at the two hospitals differed, but the impact of these differences on SARS transmission is unclear. Neither hospital had negative pressure rooms. Hospital A was a more modern facility; however, hospital B had designated SARS isolation wards and large spacious rooms with high ceilings and ceiling fans and large windows kept open for cross-ventilation. In contrast, hospital A's rooms were smaller, and individual air-conditioning units were in use early during the outbreak. In addition, hospital A had diverse patients (maternity, postoperative, pediatric, etc.) housed on the same hospital floor when the SARS outbreak began.",
    "Reported symptoms and personal health behaviors of healthcare workers are also presented in the Table. One SARS ward respondent reported a fever, and less than 23% reported either a cough or sore throat. Extreme fatigue was reported by 50% of the SARS ward workers. Antibodies to SARS-CoV among our study participants were undetectable by both laboratories. ",
    "This study has several limitations. First, our survey is subject to recall and reporting bias, because not only was it difficult for respondents to recall behaviors during specific periods within the previous 2 months, but respondents may have been concerned that results could be used to evaluate their performance. Estimates of SARS exposures and the frequency of personal protective equipment use among SARS ward workers are therefore probably inflated. Second, we collected serum specimens approximately 10 to 12 days after the last SARS patients were discharged; although these patients were discharged after their 5th to 6th week of illness, the minimal chance that a patient shed virus beyond the usual 2-to 3-week period (2) would theoretically mean that a few participants may have been tested before seroconversion. A third limitation is our lack of data on hand-washing or sanitizing practices, important means of preventing respiratory virus droplet spread."

    "The application of serum proteomics and gene expression analysis to early diagnosis and treatment decisions is a daunting challenge. It will require parties practising in previously disparate disciplines to work together and understand the data, which may be in the form of clinical information, mathematical algorithms and mass spectrometry. The challenge of 'clinical proteomics' and DNA microarrays is no longer just the development of new technologies, but rather the best use and integration of these technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. The process of this integration represents a new, evolving field of 'translational medicine'. ",
    "The integration of 'global gene profiling' into clinical medicine is exemplified in 2003 by the fact that in the early weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, the Centers for Disease Control sent tissue samples and viral cultures from SARS patients to Dr Joseph DeRisi's research team at the University of California, San Francisco. They explored the origin of the novel coronavirus using their custom oligonucleotide DNA microarray which represents 1,000 viruses. 52, 53 Of the 12,000 oligonucleotides spotted on the array, the patient samples hybridised only to a group of eight oligonucleotides representing two virus families: Coronaviridae and Astroviridae. 54 Although the identification of the novel coronavirus associated with SARS was made using a broad range of laboratory testing, this example demonstrates the power of microarray technology as a molecular diagnostic tool to test the spectrum of viruses in a single assay and to narrow, to a finite number, the potential pathogens in an unknown disease with a nonspecific clinical presentation. Admittedly, the current review is focused on genomic applications to cancer, but this example deserves special mention, given the worldwide attention on SARS. Moreover, as illustrated in this example, the integration of genomic analysis with traditional clinical and histological assessments is finding its way into clinical management.",
    "Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials. The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be realised, now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the classification of tumours into distinct, clinically relevant subtypes and the prediction of clinical outcomes. In addition, new data from the emerging proteomics platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to catalogue a complete inventory of the proteins encoded by the genome and to establish a 'biosignature' profile of human health and disease. As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of genes, gene products and signalling pathways so that the objective of personalised molecular medicine can be achieved. This paper will review the studies that best demonstrate how genomics and proteomics technologies can be used to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment it will specifically highlight the important work being incorporated into clinical trials."

    "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are loaded with epitopes to cause an immune cellular response. Most of the protein antigens are degraded in the cytoplasm to amino acids and few epitopes reach the ER. Antigen targeting of this organelle by Calreticulin (CRT) fusion avoids this degradation and enhances the immune response. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to express the E7 antigen with an ER-targeting signal peptide (SP) plus an ER retention signal (KDEL sequence). In cell-culture experiments we demonstrated that this new E7 antigen, SP-E7-KDEL, targeted the ER. Infection of mice with this recombinant adenovirus that expresses SP-E7-KDEL showed interferon induction and tumour-protection response, similar to that provided by an adenovirus expressing the E7 antigen fused to CRT. This work demonstrated that just by adding a SP and the KDEL sequence, antigens can be targeted and retained in the ER with a consequent enhancement of immune response and tumour protection. These results will have significant clinical applications. Mice.

In each district, potential participants were invited to the panel by means of proportional stratified random sampling from the population registry. Of 26,895 invited, 9% were successfully recruited.",

Until a recent analysis (22) , rabies was considered sustainable in the jackal population (H 2 ), but detailed monitoring showed that rabies is not self-sustaining because of the density of the low susceptible jackal population (S 2 ), and epidemics are frequently seeded from the domestic dog reservoir (high \u03b2 12 ).",
    "Furthermore, the evolutionary potential of a pathogen will affect its ability to infect a new host (2, 27) . Pathogens in taxa with high mutation rates, antigenic diversity, and short generation times may rapidly adapt to new hosts (28, 29) , and recent evidence suggests that RNA viruses are the most likely group to emerge in humans (26, 30) , possibly because of their high mutation rate (31) . Thus, hostparasite systems may segregate along the f 22 axis according to taxonomy. Similarly, the phylogenetic relationship between the reservoir and target host will have consequences for disease emergence; viruses are less likely to jump to new hosts as the phylogenetic distance between hosts increases (32) ."

Due to the progression of pneumonia to ARDS, non-invasive ventilation is not recommended, and early intubation may be beneficial before overt respiratory failure ensues. Corticosteroids have been used in some patients with HPAI H5N1, but no definitive role for steroids has been determined. Other immunomodulatory therapy has not been reported [91] .",

    "The HA glycoprotein mediates attachment and entry of the virus by binding to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface. The binding affinity of the HA to the host sialic acid allows for the host specificity of influenza A [6, 7] . Avian influenza subtypes prefer to bind to sialic acid linked to galactose by \u03b1-2,3 linkages, which are found in avian intestinal and respiratory epithelium ( Table 2 ) [8] . Human virus subtypes bind to \u03b1-2,6 linkages found in human respiratory epithelium [8, 9] . Swine contain both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 linkages in their respiratory epithelium, allowing for easy co-infection with both human and avian subtypes (thus acting as a 'mixing vessel' for new strains) [10] . Humans have been found to contain both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 linkages in their lower respiratory tract and conjunctivae, which allows for human infections by avian subtypes [9, 11, 12] . The HA glycoprotein is the main target for immunity by neutralizing antibodies.",
    "The timing of treatment with NA inhibitors is paramount, as early therapy is directly related to improved survival [66, [83] [84] [85] . The greatest level of protection was seen if the NA inhibitors were started within 48 hours of infection, and protection rapidly dropped after 60 hours [78, 79] . These initial studies, however, were performed with seasonal human influenza A and B, where the period of viral shedding is approximately 48 to 72 hours. In HPAI H5N1 cases from Southeast Asia, survival appeared to be improved in patients who received oseltamavir earlier (4.5 days versus 9 days after onset of symptoms) [66] . Both of these time periods are much longer than documented in animal models, so the window of optimal therapy is still unknown, particularly if viral shedding exceeds the average 48 to 72 hour period seen in seasonal influenza A and B infections."

    "As with the outbreak of avian influenza, in which humans became infected through the purchase of live poultry, a process that still continues, the SARS virus appears to have been contracted from an animal source (possibly civet cats [23] ) used for human consumption. Close contact between humans and animal vectors in the southern China region has been responsible for a number of epidemics, including influenza A. A reduction in exposure to animal viral reservoirs should reduce the occurrence of such events. To that end, the Chinese government has increased implementation of laws that prevent the consumption of wild animals."

Therefore induction of CTL activity is a major goal of vaccine development and its achievement may be determined by the ability of a carrier to deliver antigens into the MHC class I pathway. Here we report a study on the use of fd filamentous bacteriophage as an efficient carrier for delivering CTL epitopes. The bacteriophage fd is a nonpathogenic virus that is not able to infect and replicate in eukaryotic cells. All available evidence indicates that bacteriophage administration is completely harmless to humans [10] [11] [12] . In the past few years we have shown that fd bacteriophage particles represent a good antigen delivery system both for T helper and CTL epitopes since these particles intersect both class I and class II pathways [3] [4] [5] ."

    "4.2.2. Modifying Net Antibody Charge. Another method to increase antibody solubility without mutating their CDRs is by increasing the net charge of an antibody. 17, 95, 96 In one study, scFvs were \"supercharged\" by mutating solvent-exposed residues to charged residues of the same polarity. 17 Using a computational program, researchers selected charge mutations in the V H and V L domains of a scFv that were predicted to avoid destabilizing the antibody fold. Interestingly, it was found that positively charged scFvs remained much more stable and retained high binding affinities when heated, compared to negatively charged scFvs or wild-type scFvs This observation does not apply to single-domain antibodies (dAbs), as aggregation-resistant dAbs typically have net negative charges due to their acidic isoelectric points. 16,95\u221298 These studies underscore the need to better understand how charged residues impact aggregation and solubility of antibodies and antibody fragments.",
    "Together these mammalian membrane fragment technologies demonstrate how mimicking native environments can be beneficial for drug delivery, cellular studies, and proteomic work. Mammalian membranes have many benefits including low toxicity for drug delivery and correct orientation of the fragment to the nanoparticle -which is important to maintain their biological performance. Other molecules (e.g., recombinant antibodies) which are native to other parts of a cell (e.g., yeast cell wall) can also benefit by encapsulation in a native or native-like environment during protein studies.",
    "This new methodology uses transient transfection of alternating host cell lines (CHO and HEK), as shown in Figure 9A , and stringent wash steps to allow for the selection of antibodies against membrane proteins in their native conformation. Once selections have been performed, scFvs can then be stabilized utilizing the previously described nanoyeast\u2212scFv format. This new approach addresses the above limitations in the optimization of many cell-based panning methods. It allows for the rapid selection of temperature-stable cell diagnostic reagents against infectious disease targets in a simplified pipeline as compared to traditional mAb production."

We conclude that the vaccine described here has desirable properties, and our data support further development and plans for clinical trials.",
    "To the Editor: Less than a year after the identification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1), 3 independent laboratories reported protection from SARS-CoV challenge in animal models using a DNA vaccine or recombinant forms of the modified vaccinia Ankara or a parainfluenza virus, encoding the spike gene (2) (3) (4) . Their protective efficacies are encouraging because they provide proof that a SARS-CoV vaccine is feasible. However, vaccines based on those technologies are not licensed for human use, and recommendation and licensing will likely take many years. We have developed an inactivated virus vaccine that induces neutralizing antibodies and protects against SARS-CoV challenge.",
    "The vaccine was produced as described elsewhere (5) . Briefly, the SARS-CoV (strain FRA, GenBank accession no. AY310120) was grown in Vero cells, inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone (BPL), and complete inactivation was confirmed by 2 consecutive passages on Vero cells. Inactivated virus was purified by column chromatography followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The fraction containing virus was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2, and total protein content was determined by using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). Immunogenicity of the vaccine was tested by immunizing BALB/c mice at 0, 2, and 4 weeks with 5 \u00b5g of inactivated virus combined with the adjuvant MF59, an oil squalene-in-water emulsion (6) approved for human use in Europe for an influenza vaccine. Ten days after the third immunization, serum samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV spike protein-specific antibodies by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and high titers (1-3 \u00d7 10 4 ) of anti-SARS-CoV spike immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies were detected. IgG subclass determination indicated a predominant Th2-type immune response similar to that observed in BALB/c mice vaccinated with a UVinactivated SARS-CoV plus alum (7) ."

We identified MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in 81.0% of samples from the main camel-exporting countries, Sudan and Somalia, suggesting long-term virus circulation in these animals.",
    "MERS-CoV antibody-carrying dromedaries were present in all 3 countries in 1983, 1984, and 1997 ( Figure; Tables 1, 2). The high seropositivity in camels from Egypt (35 [81.4%] of 43), a country that imports camels from Sudan and Somalia, was consistent with previous studies (7, 10) . Strikingly, camels sampled in Somalia and Sudan >30 years ago were identified as MERS-CoV antibody positive with seropositivity of up to 86.7% in Sudan in 1983.",
    "MERS-CoV sequences from camels in Saudi Arabia and Qatar were closely related to sequences found in humans and did not show major genetic variability that would support long-term evolution of MERS-CoV in camels (10, 11) . The MERS-CoV sequence from a camel in Egypt was phylogenetically most distantly related to all other known camel-associated MERS-CoVs but closely related to the early human MERS-CoV isolates (10) . An urgent task would be to characterize the diversity of MERS-related CoV in other camels in Africa to elucidate whether the current epidemic MERS-CoV strains have evolved toward more efficient human transmissibility."

    "In natural disasters or terrorist attacks resulting in traumatic injuries, a roughly accurate number of surviving casualties requiring medical care is usually quickly ascertained (within hours). Epidemics differ from other disasters in that they unfold over days or even months and years. The scope and impact of epidemics (whether natural or deliberate) are not immediately apparent. If a bioattack is discovered to have occurred (e.g. if several people within a community present with inhalational anthrax), then it may be impossible to determine quickly whether there has been one attack or several or to ascertain rapidly who else is at risk. It is usually not possible to predict accurately how big an epidemic will become or how fast it can be quenched. This uncertainty has important implications for the medical mass casualty response. How is the decision made to initiate mass casualty protocols or to turn them off? How do hospitals and other health care providers plan for and implement sustained emergency responses unless they know whether an epidemic is waning or expanding?",
    "A major challenge during an epidemic or other mass casualty emergency will be to determine when, and on what basis, traditional standards of critical care are modified to accommodate emergency conditions, and when modified standards revert to traditional modes of care. Medical professionals, hospital staff, and the affected patient community should actively participate in the development and review of mass care triage standards and protocols. If engagement of care givers and the community is neglected, then mass casualty standards could be misinterpreted and generate distrust or fail to be implemented during a disaster. Medical personnel and community members must understand and agree with the triage plans and be assured that implementation will be fairly applied to all victims. Extensive efforts must be undertaken to guarantee that vulnerable populations will receive equal treatment. Coordination of all affected hospitals to facilitate implementation of similar measures under similar conditions and to reinforce the reality of fairness would be useful, but there is no such 'organizing authority' within the fragmented and mostly private US health care system.",
    "In an age of bioterrorism and epidemics of emerging infectious diseases, it will be necessary to establish interconnected electronic health information technology systems with the capacity to track patterns of disease in populations in near real time. Rapid learning in the face of an outbreak will be essential. Health information technology systems that enable sharing and near real time analysis of aggregated data could be invaluable for illuminating the course of new or unfamiliar diseases, improving clinical diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy, predicting disease outcome, and refining triage protocols. Early in an outbreak a number of treatments may be used, but if they are administered in an uncontrolled manner at the whim of clinicians then determination of their effectiveness may be difficult or impossible. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, more than 8000 people became ill over several months, and a number of treatment modalities were pursued (e.g. steroids, interferon, and ribaviran), but none within the context of a clinical trials. Were another large SARS outbreak to occur tomorrow, clinicians would have no more clinical trial data on which to base treatment decisions than they had 2 years ago [11] . To help assess treatments during the chaotic atmosphere of an outbreak, technology systems that could capture and aggregate data for large, simple, near real time clinical trials could be invaluable."

However, after 2 years of such support, in 2014, WHO reported that \"at the time of\u2026[the] second Review Committee meeting, 64 States Parties [33.16%] had indicated that they met the minimum core capacity standards\" (4), which indicated that additional effort was needed."

One common RNA folding motifs is a pseudoknot, the folding back of a single-stranded RNA onto itself to form two helical structures with single-stranded loops joining them (2) . Many such structures can be inferred from RNA sequences and frameshifting function has been demonstrated for some of these [reviewed in (3) (4) (5) ].

    "The commonly practised laboratory methods to detect the presence of a virus in clinical material have changed little in the past 25 years. A specimen is inoculated into a host system (tissue culture, eggs, animals), and subsequent detection and identification of an isolated virus depends on indicators such as cytopathic effect, hemagglutinin, complement fixation, etc. Results obtained by these procedures usually take several days-if not weeks-to complete. Thus, although they continue to serve as the backbone of most virus laboratories, current procedures are rarely capable of providing a rapid diagnosis."

    "The extent of seroconversion in close contacts of confirmed patients should provide the upper limit of SARS-CoV antibody seroprevalence in the general population, given the relatively intense exposure history of these persons to SARS patients. Our finding of the near absence of transmission resulting in asymptomatic infection in this representative high-risk group of close contacts indicates that the prevailing SARS-CoV strains in Hong Kong almost always led to clinically apparent disease. Whereas some SARS patients, especially healthcare workers, might have been initially admitted to reduce transmission to family members, virtually all SARS patients (perhaps with very few exceptions in children [4] ) had severe disease requiring inpatient treatment; thus, we can infer that infection with SARS-CoV inevitably caused severe disease requiring hospitalization."

    "B at species worldwide have been implicated as reservoirs for several emerging viruses, such as lyssaviruses, henipahviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses, and filoviruses. Bats have several physiologic, cellular, and natural history characteristics that may make them particularly suited to their role as reservoir hosts (1, 2) .",

However, minimal or no clinical improvement was observed, and the bats showed progressive joint swelling and increased lethargy. All bats were eventually euthanized. In all instances, gross lesions were limited to the joints.",

We propose that the bat-derived isolate be distinguished as part of a new lineage with the suggested genus designation Chiropoxvirus. Further efforts should be undertaken to determine whether Cotia virus should be included in this genus. The bat-derived virus requires a new species designation for which we propose Eptesipox virus because of its isolation from an Eptesicus fuscus bat specimen.",
    "Chordopoxviridae is a subfamily of Poxviridae that contains large double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate in the cellular cytoplasm and are known to infect a wide range of vertebrates. Many of these viruses cause zoonotic disease in humans. Although poxviruses are known to have incorporated host genes into their genomes to subvert the host immune system (3), bats and poxviruses may also serve as facilitators in the horizontal transfer of transposable elements to other species (4) (5) (6) . We report the isolation and characterization of a viable poxvirus from bats."

    "Many viral mRNAs are capped, in that they contain a single major initiation site near their 5' end, and their translation is similar to that of host mRNA. However, inhibition of host mRNA translation provides the virus with increased availability of ribosomal units. Thus herpes simplex and poxvirus degrade cellular mRNA to decrease its translation (Inglis, 1982; Fenwick and McMenamin, 1984) .",

However, a logical alternative approach is the use of a noncytotoxic agent that has the capacity to inhibit many different respiratory viruses simultaneously, and recent evidence indicates that certain herbal extracts could fulfill this requirement [15] [16] [17] ."

Rather, readiness to adopt protective behavior depended on subjective knowledge and overconfidence in ability to self-protect.",
    "Our results indicate that not considering subjective knowledge and positive illusions can lead to the erroneous conclusion that increasing actual knowledge will necessarily translate into behavioral change and good practices. EVD communication would benefit from research showing that promoting behavioral change requires changing subjective evaluations of risk to make it self-relevant and to induce a reappraisal of the perceived benefits of (or costs of not) performing safe behavior (10). ",
    "Our observations of suboptimal actual knowledge about EVD replicated findings of past knowledge, attitudes, and practices studies (3-6); however, we went further by showing that relationships between actual versus subjective knowledge and perceptions of risk for EVD differed. The fact that subjective knowledge and positive illusions, but not actual knowledge, were associated with protective behavior intentions is problematic, especially because actual knowledge was low. Persons' belief that they know how to protect themselves when they actually do not and the feeling of knowing added to a feeling of overconfidence in how to self-protect might result in risky rather than safe behavior (7) ."

    "As the sequencing revolution continues to gather steam, and the rate of viral genome sequencing increases, reference databases will be pressed to serve growing community needs. Meeting these will require further collaboration with individual viral communities and across public databases. Data models will also need to shift to better represent the extant sequence universe and provide better standardized sequence annotation.",
    "A new emphasis has been placed on initiating annotation collaborations at the beginning of a large genome sequencing program so that reference annotations, isolate naming schemes and other standards can be established prior to sequence submission (42) (43) (44) . These collaborations often include members of the UniProt Viral Protein Annotation Program (45) (9), and/or curators from sequencing centers and other databases (46) in addition to members of the relevant viral communities and effectively ensure both well annotated references and consistently annotated INSDC sequence records. Such arrangements underscore the extensive impact of viral genome annotation issues--from public databases to sequencing centers to individual researcher communities--and were formalized within the Viral Genome Annotation Working Group, which brings together stakeholders and provides a forum for the discussion of annotation issues (29, 47) . In addition to protein annotation and isolate naming issues, this group is working to define standards for viral genome sequence data.",
    "The growing cloud of viral genome sequences also poses significant barriers to the maintenance of reference genome records. The pace of experimental discovery and the number and breadth of viral genomes make it increasingly difficult to provide well annotated, up-to-date reference sequences. To counter, we must leverage community knowledge and activities against the goal of better RefSeq viral resources and must collaborate with viral communities to maintain well annotated reference sequences, develop community-accepted gene and protein naming standards and define community-established subspecies classification schemes. Though collaborations have been initiated within D576 Nucleic Acids Research, 2015, Vol. 43, Database issue some communities (29, (42) (43) (44) 47) , they need to be scaled to include more groups. As a public resource, we serve a range of communities--from the public health to the basic research--and rely on them to both better inform our mission and help support it. Only by engaging our stakeholders and working together on shared goals can we provide the rigorous resources necessary to support viral sequence data activities.",
    "Once annotated, large-scale genome sequence data will need to be presented in ways that facilitate human data sorting and discovery operations. This will require semiautomated metadata capture and standardization, as well as innovative interfaces and tools that leverage metadata in discovery operations. Many of these approaches and processes are currently being tested within the NCBI Virus Variation Resource (25) where users can readily find sequences based on specific, standardized sequence descriptors, greatly improving the accessibility and utility of viral sequence data. While currently limited to a handful of human pathogens, our intent is to expand the Virus Variation data model to include more viruses from more viral communities. This should open up a number of possibilities and will support the aggregation and retrieval of sequences based on community-defined criteria like genotypes or complete genome sets as is currently possible for influenza virus sequences (11, 25) ."

APM encodes specifi c translation proteins that are more commonly associated with cellular organisms than with viruses (2) .",
    "If we assume an APM prevalence of 0.2% (1 case in the study sample), the estimated probability of obtaining our results by chance, based on binomial analysis, would be 0.37. Most of the specimens we tested were from the upper respiratory tract, whereas the only reported APM PCR-positive sample was from a lower respiratory bronchoalveolar lavage specimen (3) . Moreover, the patient populations sampled may not represent those at highest risk for APM infection. Nevertheless, our study supports the fi ndings of an Austrian study that failed to detect APM in 214 nasopharyngeal specimens from hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms (8) ."

    "The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (95% CrI 5.2-7.9 days) for 36 patients who died compared with 7.1",
    "Our study had some limitations. Our estimates of the incubation period were based on self-reported exposure data, which could be affected by recall bias. Moreover, 61 patients (36%) included in our main analysis had missing exposure data, and inclusion in a Bayesian framework with a wide interval of 0-21 days was necessary. Both of these limitations could have reduced the statistical power of our study to identify an association. Finally, we did not have information on underlying medical conditions or the geographic location of cases, or the treatments that were given to cases, and these variables could have been associated with clinical outcomes.",
    "In conclusion, we found an association between shorter incubation periods among patients with MERS-CoV infection and a higher risk of death subsequently, similar to the association previously reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (9) . This association might occur because the duration of the incubation period is an early reflection of disease pathogenesis. ",
    "Another potential explanation for our findings is that patients with longer incubation periods were identified and infection confirmed more quickly. This improvement in time to identification and admission to a hospital led to improved prognosis. Although longer incubation periods were correlated with shorter delays from onset to laboratory confirmation, we did not find evidence of a strong mediating effect of delay from onset to laboratory confirmation on the risk for death. However, with the small sample size, there was limited statistical power to detect a smallto-moderate effect."

In particular, progress is hampered by the fact that the majority of antiviral drugs are specific for only one virus. Current approaches are expensive, require rapid identification of the virus before therapy and, at the initial stages of development, involve enormous redundancy of research effort. This also results in efforts being concentrated on a few viruses; of the 60 antiviral drugs that have so far been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), almost half target HIV-1; the remaining half are used for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza (IAV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections [2] ."

    "An alternative way to broaden vaccine immunogenicity and increase its efficacy has been to use combination of plasmids encoding various antigens. For examples, cysteine proteinase (CP) a and b DNA vaccines are not protective when used individually, but immunization with a combination of both plasmids induces long-term protective immunity [34] . Alternatively, gene fusion has also been successively used to achieve expression of an antigenic fusion protein from a single plasmid construct [33] . Overall, expression of several antigens mostly resulted in increased efficacy, but this also depended on the antigen combination [13, 22, 23, 41, 45] ."

    "These questions should be answered carefully and systematically. Given the greater number of microspheres bound to eggs in the high affinity group, the populations should be separable using external magnetic fields of differing strengths. Egg-microparticle binding mechanisms for each population could be interrogated by determining solution properties (e.g., pH, salt, surfactant, chelators, blocking proteins, etc.) required to interrupt the interactions. Additionally, functionalizing microspheres in a way that systematically varies their zeta potential and hydrophobicity could determine the role these physiochemical properties play in binding. These studies will be crucial if the Helmintex method aims to determine infection intensity using quantitative egg enrichment. This is particularly important for schistosomiasis surveillance and morbidity control campaigns, which aim to quantify and reduce the prevalence of high-intensity infections.",

Originally reverse genetics in Drosophila relied upon random P-element insertions that induced mutations [15] [16] [17] . Now mutations can be specifically targeted by homologous recombination [18] [19] [20] or specific gene products can be depleted by expressing siRNAs to genes in specific tissues or cells [21] [22] [23] .

    "If a randomized trial is not considered justified, feasible, or ethical, therapeutic agents of unknown efficacy should not be used without attempts to systematically document illness severity, clinical course, treatment, adverse events, and confounding factors in a standardized manner to facilitate analysis.

Based on the World Health Organization's initial case definition, persons presenting with fever, respiratory symptoms, and an epidemiologically defined exposure are considered to have SARS (14) . This definition is non-specific, as all patients with febrile respiratory illnesses, regardless of etiology, will be included if they have any exposure history. This was particularly problematic in returned travelers with respiratory illness. Because direct SARS exposure was uncommon among travelers, even to high-risk areas, inclusion of travel-related cases in our trial would have resulted in a low positive predictive value for the case definition.",
    "Due to the unknown size of an outbreak, the use of composite endpoints is a reasonable strategy to maximize the number of observed outcomes and minimize the required sample size, provided every component of the composite endpoint is clinically relevant and can be measured in a standardized manner.",
    "The unpredictable nature of outbreaks poses many challenges to the successful design and implementation of such trials. Creation of national or international collaborative groups, with a mandate to implement clinical trials of therapeutic agents in outbreak settings, and supported by appropriate funding, may be the best strategy for achieving this goal. The collaboration of ethics review boards in establishing a process which facilitates trials while ensuring the safety of participating patients, researchers, and communities, is critical."

The selection of a second line vasopressor, such as vasopressin, dopamine, phenylephrine, epinephrine or angiotensin-2, depends on patient factors such as underlying cardiac dysfunction, presence of arrhythmias, and current response to vasoconstrictor or inotropic agents. Dopamine should not be used for renal perfusion or protection and it should be avoided in patients with tachyarrhythmias.",
    "Sepsis clinically manifests as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. 1 Optimal fluid resuscitation is relevant for all sepsis patients, and perhaps it is most important for those with septic shock. Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greatest risk of mortality, and septic shock is clinically identified as sepsis patients with serum lactate level .2 mmol/L and who require vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure $ 65 mm Hg in the absence of hypovolemia. Sepsis is among the most common conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), accounting for up to half of all hospital deaths and being the third leading cause of death overall in the United States. 2",
    "Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies for which treatment and resuscitation should begin immediately. The goals of fluid resuscitation for these patients are: a) to rapidly replace intravascular volume and restore tissue perfusion, and b) to minimize organ dysfunction through timely interventions that either halt or reverse the physiologic derangements. If hypoperfusion is present, at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given rapidly, and additional fluids should be guided by frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status, preferably using dynamic indices to indicate the likelihood of a beneficial response to fluid administration. Fluid administration should be targeted to achieve a MAP of at least 65 mm Hg, and to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate due to hypoperfusion. 3 Balanced crystalloids are the fluid of first choice for sepsis resuscitation based on ready availability and taking medication costs into account. Use of 0.9% saline compared to a balanced crystalloid, such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte, produces more kidney dysfunction and with a greater risk of dying. 4 The individual side effect profiles may best differentiate the natural and synthetic colloids. Albumin may be considered for administration to sepsis patients with refractory shock or who have received substantial amounts of crystalloid fluids, but should not be administered to patients with severe traumatic brain injury. 5 Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) products should not be administered to patients with sepsis because of increased risk of acute kidney injury and death. Gelatin solutions are not recommended in sepsis."

    "First, the editorial board of eCAM is one that is diverse, and to ensure one aspect of creativity, many of us have never worked together, thus allowing for the infusion of different points of view. Our first purpose in establishing the eCAM editorial board has been to gather a mixture of experienced biomedical scientists and to combine them with newcomers from a variety of fields who are willing to embrace CAM and to extend themselves beyond their better known academic classifications or 'pigeonholes'. As one of our bases is in Japan, our search for diversity began in Asia at biomedical conferences and research centers in Japan,",
    "Finally, despite these examples of diversity in numbers, geographical origins and disciplines and scientific approach, there is the difficulty of reconciling the very nature of CAM with certain realities, i.e. the palpable need to undergird CAM with evidence-based results that can, through rigor, occupy the pinnacle of the experimental triangle devoted to immunological benefits as proposed by Goldrosen and Strauss (24) . For, as has been pointed out in previous editorials, there is a need for rigorous science if CAM and indeed eCAM are to be taken more seriously, thus ensuring less skepticism from its adherents and disciples and also from the traditional medical establishment and pharmaceutical industry. Now and in the near future, eCAM is discussing ways to consider seriously case reports, not the ideal within an acceptable scientific context. An excellent example devoted to Alzheimer's disease has led the way (25) ."

The application of this method for the identification of viruses is even more restricted due to the small size of viral particles which cannot be studied by conventional optical microscopy and requires the use of electron microscopy for visualization."

Infection may also occur after eating insufficiently cooked meat from an infected animal or contaminated drinking water, causing symptoms from the digestive tract, and by inhalation of contaminated dust, causing a pneumonialike illness."

Further studies are needed to assess resource usage in other healthcare settings such as intensive care units, fever clinics, general practice, and the community."

    "In addition to the important role in recycling of amino acids from damaged or misfolded proteins, ubiquitin-protein conjugation also has functions unrelated to proteasomal targeting. For example, polyubiquitination is required for the internalization of several yeast and mammalian cell surface proteins into the endocytic pathway (15, 16) . Interestingly, p62 appears to sequester ubiquitinated substrates into a cytoplasmic structure referred to as a sequestosome, into which excess ubiquitinated proteins are segregated (17) . In addition, p62 is an immediate early response gene product for a variety of signals (18) . Thus, p62 appears to play a novel regulatory role for polyubiquitinated proteins and may have an essential function in cell proliferation and differentiation. We have developed a method that will enable identification of protein(s) that interact with p62's UBA domain."

Corticosteroids have been used as an adjunct therapy for severe infection for roughly half a century. Contrasting with the clinical practice, researchers are continuing to argue the pros and cons of this therapeutic approach [2] .",
    "The use of corticosteroids for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia has been reported for almost 50 years. A recent systematic analysis of the relevant literature suggested that corticosteroids reduce the critical illness associated with communityacquired pneumonia. There is little doubt that a prolonged administration of a moderate dose of corticosteroids may alleviate the systemic inflammatory response and subsequent organ dysfunction in severe infection. Whether these favorable effects on morbidity may translate into better survival and quality of life needs to be addressed in additional adequately powered randomized controlled trials.",
    "In theory, corticosteroids may favor the onset of gastroduodenal bleeding, superinfection, metabolic disorders, and muscle weakness. A recent systematic review on the use of corticosteroids for severe sepsis and septic shock, however, failed to show any evidence for an increased risk of bleeding, superinfection, or neuromuscular weakness, whereas hypernatremia and hyperglycaemia occurred more frequently in treated patients (D. Annane, personal communication). It is important for physicians to implement preventive measures and to perform daily screening for possible complications. A specific surveillance of potential sites of superinfection and control of blood glucose and serum sodium levels should be systematically performed."

    "In 1 year, >250,000 persons have been infected by a new CHIKV variant on the Indian Ocean islands. Although major differences in the fitness or virulence of CHIKV may be associated with minor genetic differences, the most likely explanation for this devastating outbreak is the penetration into a region where the population is immunologically naive for CHIKV and where Ae. albopictus proliferates. As this outbreak has spread, we believe this type of outbreak could occur in other regions of the world where competent vectors are prevalent. Because of high viremia, the virus could also be directly transmitted to healthcare workers. We must be prepared for the possibility of similar arboviral epidemics in such places. "

Sentinel unvaccinated birds are kept in each house to monitor for virus shedding, antigenic drift, or both.",
    "Early detection and aggressive control measures allowed Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia to eradicate H5N1 virus soon after its introduction into those countries' poultry flocks, demonstrating that rapid and determined responses can keep the virus from gaining a foothold. In other countries in Asia, delayed detection and response caused the virus to become entrenched across a wide region, and eradication at this stage has become a formidable undertaking.",
    "I nfluenza is an ancient disease that has infected humans at irregular intervals throughout recorded history (1) . While the 1918 \"Spanish\" influenza is the best recorded catastrophic influenza pandemic, similarly severe pandemics occurred earlier, when the human population of the world was much smaller, and they will occur again. Our challenge is to understand all aspects of the influenza virus, the hosts and their response, and the virus' global impact so that we may be better prepared to face the inevitable next influenza pandemic."

A superspreading strain might be marked with other pathobiologically important features. In the case presented here (indeed emerging and MDR), the NGS-based in silico spoligotyping would confuse the MDR/extensively drug resistant SIT266 with \"less dangerous\" SIT264. To be precise, the revealed discrepancy is not inherent to the NGS technology itself. Although the general limitation of the use of short sequencing reads to infer repetitive genome regions is known, it did not pose a problem in our study. However, both bioinformatics tools predicted the spoligoprofile solely from the presence or absence of spacer sequences and did not take into account a \"hiding\" effect exerted by a putative IS6110 insertion on adjacent spacer under classical spoligotyping.",

    "In conclusion, the epidemic of a new infectious disease, SARS, took firstly China and subsequently many other areas in the world completely by surprise. In the end, the consequences of this epidemic in terms of people afflicted and economic loss were not entirely catastrophic. Also, it turned out that SARS could be controlled relatively easily through standard interventions. However, the epidemic revealed some important weaknesses in the Chinese public health system, which has been dealt with efficiently by the Chinese government. At this point in time, China is better prepared than ever for epidemics, which may very well be worse than SARS in terms of speed of spread and number of deaths. As a matter of fact, SARS can justly be seen as a wake-up call.",
    "Second, there were long-term health consequences for those former SARS patients who were treated with corticosteroids. Lv et al. investigated the relationship between avascular osteonecrosis (AVN) and corticosteroid treatment given to patients with SARS through a longitudinal study of 71 former SARS patients (mainly HCWs) who had been treated with corticosteroids, with an observation time of 36 months. 22 Magnetic resonance images and X-rays of hips, knees, shoulders, ankles and wrists were taken as part of the post-SARS follow-up assessments. Thirty-nine per cent (39%) developed AVN of the hips within 3-4 months after starting treatment. Two more cases of hip necrosis were seen after 1 year and another 11 cases of AVN were diagnosed after 3 years, one with hip necrosis and 10 with necrosis in other joints. In total, a staggering 58% of the cohort had developed AVN after 3 years of observation. The sole factor explaining AVN in the hip was the total dose of corticosteroids received, which ranged from 1000 to 10 000 mg for the majority of cases, but was as high as 25 000 in some cases. 22 The use of corticosteroids as well as other drugs (e.g. rib- Lessons learnt and actions taken in China regarding epidemic preparedness",
    "SARS was caused by a novel coronavirus that was provisionally termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 3, 4 The earliest cases of SARS occurred in mid-November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. SARS was first recognised in February 2003, when cases with an atypical pneumonia of unknown cause began appearing among hospital staff in Guangzhou, China. Within weeks, similar outbreaks occurred in Hanoi, Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Taiwan. Soon thereafter, cases were reported from 32 countries and regions (later corrected to 29). After July 2003, SARS came under control thanks to enormous efforts made by national and international organisations. More than 8000 cases were reported worldwide, with over 5000 from mainland China, making the country the epicentre of the outbreak. 5 During the SARS outbreak in China, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained in difficult circumstances. The available data were only to a limited extent analysed and reported, and mainly in Chinese literature. There was a need for good documentation, accessible to the international scientific community. The first step in the collaboration was to integrate all existing Chinese SARS data into one final database. 6 With this comprehensive nationwide database it was possible to perform in-depth studies and dissect the SARS epidemic in mainland China, answering many questions that up to now were only studied in part or not at all.",
    "There were many obvious immediate consequences of the epidemic, such as substantial morbidity and mortality, fear for becoming infected, panic in the public domain, stringent quarantine measures, travel restrictions, etc. Also two important middle and long-term consequences of the epidemic were identified. First, there was the economic impact. This was studied for Beijing by Beutels et al. 21 through associating time series of daily and monthly SARS cases and deaths and volume of public train, airplane and cargo transport, tourism, household consumption patterns and gross domestic product growth in Beijing. It was concluded that especially leisure activities, local and international transport and tourism were affected by SARS, particularly in May 2003. Much of this consumption was merely postponed; but irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector alone were estimated at about US$ 1.4 billion, or 300 times the cost of treatment for SARS cases in Beijing."

Antigen design will be directed by a deep knowledge of cross-protective epitopes in humans.

A more rational vaccine design will hopefully allow the development of effective preventive vaccines for all remaining 'difficult' targets including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.",

A lot of work needs to be done to rationally design and express the target antigens (e.g. HA or Env) in a form that stabilizes cross-reactive epitopes and makes them sufficiently immunogenic. The only way to achieve this goal is to have a deep structural knowledge of the candidate antigens (Fig. 1) ."

    "The cases of chikungunya viral fever are burgeoning every year. Infections are not only limited to Asia and Africa; recently, the epidemics of chikungunya have been reported from Central and South America. 1, 2 Concerning the data obtained from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP, India), the number of infected people identified in April 2018 was 9175, 4875 from Karnataka following 1375 from Gujarat and 966 from Maharashtra. Earlier research studies have shown that there is considerable resource burden from chikungunya outbreaks, which escalates in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Therefore, cases of chikungunya viral fever have increased in the continent of Asia and various parts of the world. The name chikungunya originates from \"Makonde\", meaning \"to become twisted\". It denotes the \"curved\" appearance of those going through joint ache as a result of chikungunya infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spreads by mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The common eukaryotic hosts are primates and humans. In humans, the symptoms associated with CHIKV are nausea, fever, joint pain, vomiting, rashes, and persistent arthralgia.",
    "Clinical manifestation is one of the bases for the diagnosis of chikungunya infection, but the confirmation of disease can only be made after laboratory tests. Suspected cases are validated by positive anti-Chikungunya virus IgM or IgG results or by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. 3, 4 In Togaviridae family, CHIKV comes under the genus Alphavirus. Alphaviruses are configured as enveloped positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 29 members in the alphavirus genus; some members of the genus contain several animal and human viruses like Ross River virus, Sindbis virus (SINV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), Semiliki Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), etc. They are furthermore categorized into Old World and New World viruses reliant on the changes that occurred in their life cycle, fatality, and clinical manifestations. Basically, the Old World viruses CHIKV, SINV, SFV, etc. engage the protein nsp2 to downregulate the host cell transcription, have less demise percentage, and stimulate arthralgia. The New World viruses VEEV, WEEV, etc. use virus capsid protein (CP) to downregulate the host cell transcription, have high casualty frequency, and generate encephalitis."

    "The model is a promising tool for future research because it induces reversible pharyngeal irritation, in controlled conditions, and is amenable to a crossover study design. It may provide a valuable research tool and an objective way of measuring the therapeutic potential of treatments. Furthermore, this procedure may also allow for research in occupational and environmental medicine where exposure limits for single potential irritants exist but interactions are not yet well established. In this way, a CDA stimulus may be combined with one or two potential irritants in order to generate comparable results in crossover study designs.",
    "Ambient air pollution is a common cause of sore throat. The factors implicated include ozone, nitrogen oxides, and fine dust.",
    "Ozone has an inflammatory effect on both the upper and lower respiratory tract, characterised by polymorph infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [135] [136] [137] , although the specifics relating to sore throat are less certain. The underlying mechanism is proposed to include a direct effect of ozone on respiratory tract cell membranes and fluid, with lipid ozonation products activating specific lipases, triggering the release of endogenous mediators of inflammation [138, 139] such as prostaglandin E, IL8, thromboxane B2 and calcitonin gene-related peptide.",
    "There are some more specific animal models with objective endpoints. Pharyngeal inflammation was induced in a rat model by applying capsaicin directly to the pharyngeal mucosa [159] . Intubation has been used to induce pharyngeal inflammation in a swine model [117] and laryngeal inflammation in a rat model [160] , with analysis of biomarkers. Well-defined human models of pharyngeal irritation with objective endpoints are generally lacking. One that is in research use is the Tonsilliopharyngeal assessment (TPA) scale which is based on a clinical examination of the throat [158] , although this still depends on the clinician's judgement. Currently, any correlation between subjective and objective endpoints is therefore untested."

    "Improved hand hygiene, barrier precautions, patient use of hand sanitizers or facemasks, and avoidance of environmental fomites can each diminish dissemination risk. However, these measures depend on individual behavior, rendering them susceptible to implementation failure. Temporal segregation adds a system-based layer of protection to such behavior-based interventions, providing an additional barrier to pathogen dissemination that is not critically dependent on individual compliance. When additional data addressing pathogen transmission within the clinic become available (currently such data are sparse), mathematical models could help guide the allocation of resources required to support system-based infection-control measures. Moreover, numerical experimentation could help inform the design of infection-control strategies for pathogens that have transmission dynamics that are not yet well characterized.",

    "The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes economically important upper respiratory and urogenital tract diseases in chickens, resulting in tracheal rales, sneezing, coughing, reduced weight gain, and reduction of egg production [5] . IBV, the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is found worldwide [5, 15] . The genome of IBV consists of a single-stranded sense RNA genome encoding four structural proteins, which are envelope glycoprotein, integral membrane glycoprotein, phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [15, 22] . The S glycoprotein is cleaved post-translationally by cellular proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits [4] . The globular S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, extending outward, whereas the S2 subunit anchors the S1 moiety to the viral membrane [1] . The S1 subunit is involved in viral infectivity, virus-neutralizing epitopes, serotype-specific sequences, and hemagglutinin activity [1] [2] [3] 11, 12] ."

    "While it is extremely likely that the human MHC is critical to immune response, both against foreign and self antigens, few experiments have yielded results as clear as those in mice. For most immunologic disorders where an association with the MHC has been sought, analysis of observations in populations have been hampered by MHC polymorphism, as well as by many confounding clinical factors such as ethnic variation in the distribution of MHC alleles, environmental factors, and the additive effects of non-MHC genes.",
    "Although the MHC is a complex system, the recognition of common gene combinations in humans, or extended haplotypes, has clarified, and sometimes identified for the first time, relationships between MHC genes and immunologic function and dysfunction. Many questions can be explored using this approach-the relationship between specific haplotypes and gluten-sensitive enteropathy [37] , pemphigus vulgaris [38] , and diabetes [39] , for example. Others merit possible consideration-for example, could unrelated bone marrow donors be chosen based on extended haplotype matching (which we would predict could be successful despite selective HLA-A allele mismatching)? The concept of extended haplotypes should provide a useful framework for interpreting data from a variety of studies of the immune system over the coming years.",
    "As they are in mice, the genes of the human MHC are highly polymorphic, including at least 24 variants of HLA-A, 52 variants of HLA-B, 11 of HLA-C, 20 of HLA-DR, nine of HLA-DQ, and six of HLA-DP [14] . Such polymorphisms may have been important in an evolutionary sense in the development of immunity, although, ironically, at the expense of a greater likelihood of graft rejection [ 12] ."

    "Among those who contract infl uenza, subsequent illness and death may be infl uenced by underlying factors and conditions and by the timeliness and effectiveness of various treatment modalities. Most infl uenza illnesses are self-limiting, and most infected persons during both annual infl uenza epidemics and infl uenza pandemics (including that of 1918-19) recover with only supportive care in the community. Even so, current planning efforts recognize the potential importance of reducing disease during a pandemic, through early treatment with antiviral drugs and through other forms of treatment such as respiratory support and antimicrobial agents to treat secondary bacterial pneumonia, among those with more severe disease.",
    "On a US government website for pandemic infl uenza (www.pandemicfl u.gov), a question asks which groups would be especially vulnerable during an infl uenza pandemic. The answer notes that people may be vulnerable for a variety of reasons, including limited access to healthcare; limited profi ciency in English; or being disabled, homeless, economically disadvantaged, or a single parent. The response calls for faith-based and community-based organizations to develop plans \"to care for dependent populations\" and to \"provide fi nancial aid to the poor who are unable to work and are in need of emergency income for housing, medicine, or other essential needs\" (www.pandemicfl u.gov/faq/pandemicinfl uenza/pi-0001.html), which implies that attention to the needs of economically or socially vulnerable persons is not primarily a public-sector responsibility but is more a matter for private charity. The 2005 HHS plan (37) itself acknowledges that some groups may need fi nancial assistance if they are unable to work but does not indicate how that assistance would be provided or who would provide it.",
    "The Pandemic Infl uenza Plan of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (37) does not adequately address potential social disparities in exposure, vaccination, or treatment; the possible effects of such disparities; or strategies for minimizing or eliminating them. The HHS plan (37) , the federal guidance on vaccine allocation (38) , and the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for community-level mitigation strategies (18) should be credited for calling for community engagement and inclusion of a wide variety of stakeholders in planning at the local level. Outreach to providers, community leaders, and organizations, particularly in disadvantaged communities, will be an important component of any strategy for addressing disparities during a pandemic. However, the available versions of offi cial plans do not call attention to the need for special efforts to overcome the greater barriers likely to be faced by socially disadvantaged groups."

Briefly, total RNA and random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were incubated at 72 degrees for 10 minutes. Reverse transcription was performed using the Superscript II RT enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and followed the specification of the manufacturer. cDNA was diluted to 200\u00b5l with water and 4\u00b5l was used for quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green kit (Abgene, Epson, UK).

The primers were used at 10 nM. Serial dilutions of cDNA containing a known copy number of each gene were used in each quantitative PCR run to generate a standard curve relating copy number with threshold amplification cycle (45).

    "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that remains a major cause of disability (1) . Several studies demonstrated that MS lesions contain multiple leukocyte cell types including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells all of which are believed to contribute to lesion formation by various distinct and interacting mechanisms (2, 3) . Among these leukocyte subsets, infiltrating macrophages have been identified as major effectors of demyelination in both MS and animal models for MS (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . In accord with these studies, it was recently described that a predominant mechanism of demyelination in MS is macrophage-mediated (12) ."

SV40 became of particular interest to virologists and cell biologists alike as being the first virus shown to enter cells via a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway (Anderson et al. 1996) . In fact it was, at least in part, the study of SV40 entry which led to the discovery of what we know as caveolar endocytosis and the caveosome, and as such, labelled SV40 is often used as a tool to study intracellular trafficking (Fig. 2) .",

The first electron micrographs of influenza-infected cells demonstrated particles inside cytoplasmic compartments. Subsequently, the particles were seen to penetrate the membrane of this compartment followed by genome release in the cytosol (Dourmashkin and Tyrrell 1974) . While this evidence pointed towards an endocytic mechanism of entry, the images failed to show the fusion of viral and host cell membranes that is believed to play a critical role in escaping the low pH environment of the endosome."

Sequencing of the genome of the mallard duck is warranted, as it could provide insight into the factors that contribute to markedly reduced influenza virus pathogenicity."

Pelleted virions were resuspended in PBS and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. Inoculation of HRT18 monolayers in 96-well format was performed with equal amounts of S-pseudotyped virions, as calculated from VSV-N content (roughly corresponding to the yield from 2 \u00d7 105 transfected and transduced cells), diluted in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM. At 18h post-infection, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase expression was measured using a firefly luciferase assay system. Infection experiments were performed independently in triplicate, each time with three technical replicates. Pseudovirus incorporation of flag-tagged OC43 S was determined for the parental type and each of the mutants by Western blotting and by calculating the S content (measured with monoclonal antibody ANTI-FLAG \u00ae M2; Sigma) relative to that of VSV-N (measured with anti-VSV N monoclonal antibody 10G4; Kerafast)."

MERS-CoV causes respiratory and renal illness in humans, and infection often progresses to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, or death in a subset of patients (2) . Risk factors, including patient age, preexisting health conditions, and high viral load in upper respiratory specimens, have been suggested to be related to disease severity and death (3, 4) . However, pathogenesis and clinical characteristics promoting recovery from infection or progression to serious organ failure have not been well elucidated.",

    "The simulations of the stochastic model were carried out using Gillespie's direct algorithm (Gillespie 1977) . In short, the interevent times are sampled from an exponential distribution with parameter R 5 P 8 k51 r k (Renshaw 1991) . The specific event type that then occurs is obtained by drawing a random variate from a discrete distribution with probability p(k) \u00bc r k /R corresponding to event type k, k \u00bc 1-8, as defined above. Once the event type has been chosen, a similar sampling process is applied to determine the affected individual on the basis of its relative rate compared to that of other individuals belonging to the same category.",
    "In the simulations, infection was introduced into an initially fully susceptible population through one latent infected individual. The simulations were carried out for closed populations with no birth or death or removal processes and for which disease progression was not influenced by treatment effects. The model was run for a simulated time period of 3 years, after which the infection either died out or, as indicated by preliminary results, converged to equilibrium prevalence in all simulated scenarios. Ten thousand replicates were generated for each parameter combination.",

    "D uring the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), large nosocomial outbreaks of SARS occurred in several hospitals in Singapore (1, 2) . Since then, concerns have been raised about how emerging infections, in particular respiratory infections, could result in transmission from patients to healthcare workers and vice versa, given the high frequency and intensity of healthcare worker contacts in the hospital environment (3) . For pandemic infl uenza, additional concerns exist that even mild disease might result in staff absenteeism and, subsequently, would reduce staff strength at a time of increased demand for health services (4) .",
    "We do acknowledge several limitations in our study. First, our fi ndings are based on data from healthcare workers from just 1 hospital. Moreover, the unexpectedly low seroconversion rates in our cohort reduced the power of the study to investigate exposures more weakly associated with the outcome. We were also unable to assess the usefulness of personal protective equipment due to the lack of appropriate control groups. The resolution of exposure data from what was a self-administered questionnaire survey was also lower than insights that may be gained from detailed case investigations or exposure diaries that have been used in the healthcare setting (3, 11) . Finally, the lack of randomization also leaves scope for bias in our results.",
    "Although defi nitively attributing the low infection rates in healthcare workers to improved infection control practices is diffi cult without the appropriate control groups, much evidence supports the effi cacy of the common bundle of measures used in hospitals to reduce spread of respiratory viruses (21) . Notably, there was a high level of preparedness and widespread implementation of airborne and respiratory droplet precautions and other pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection control practices in healthcare institutions in the United States, Singapore, and elsewhere (11, 13, (22) (23) (24) ."

The inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine may be the first one available for clinical use because it is easy to generate; however, safety is the main concern. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit of S protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes. This suggests that recombinant proteins containing RBD and vectors encoding the RBD sequence can be used to develop safe and effective SARS vaccines."

Likewise, nothing has been done to ensure worldwide production and distribution of the vaccines and antiviral agents being developed. A similar approach must not be allowed to govern the research agenda for generic agents.",
    "While these studies are under way, an analysis should be undertaken for each candidate agent to determine which companies produce them, where each is manufactured, annual levels of production (and surge capacity), patterns of distribution to other developing countries, and costs for public markets (Table 3) . Special attention must be given to companies that follow Good Manufacturing Practices to minimize the risk that some of these agents might be counterfeit. When animal studies have defi ned 1 or more promising regimens, an international process must be set up to develop logistics for fi nancing, producing, and distributing each agent."

    "CLRs comprise a large family of receptors which bind carbohydrates, through one or more carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), or which possess structurally similar C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) which do not necessarily recognize carbohydrate ligands. CLRs are divided into 17 groups based on features including phylogeny and structure (Zelensky and Gready, 2005) . Discussed in this review are CLRs from groups II (calcium-dependent lectins with single CRDs), group V (calcium-independent receptors with single CTLDs) and group VI (calcium-dependent lectins with multiple CRDs) (see Table 1 ). Based on their signalling potential, CLRs can be further subdivided into (i) activation Syk-coupled CLRs with immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motif (ITAM) domains, (ii) inhibitory CLRs with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) domains or (iii) CLRs without clear ITAM or ITIM domains such as MR, DEC-205 and DC-SIGN (Zelensky and Gready, 2005; Sancho and Reis e Sousa, 2012) .",
    "Activation of CLRs can induce intracellular signalling pathways in two ways: firstly through indirect signalling, where receptors such as macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle or CLEC4E), Dectin-2 (CLEC6A) and C-type lectin domain family 5A (CLEC5A) associate with ITAM containing adaptor molecules such as Fc Receptor \u03b3-chain (FcR\u03b3) or DAP12.",
    "Recently, CLECSF8 was also shown to be important in the resolution of pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (Steichen et al., 2013) . CLECSF8 \u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice to pneumonic sepsis, with increased bacterial burdens, hyperinflammation and severe lung pathology which correlated with a massive accumulation of neutrophils. These results suggest that CLECSF8 plays an important role in resolution of inflammation, and is the first report describing a physiological function for this CLR."

    "Since the HPV virion capsomers are composed of five L1 proteins, and one L2 each, it is possible that a surface accessible antigen in one protein may get covered by the folds of a neighboring protein.",
    "Determination of epitope segments. Next, we consider which of the segments from the second-stage choice contains epitope regions to elicit necessary immune response. For this, we use two epitope-prediction tools, viz., the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and Analysis Resource server [32] [33] [34] [35] and ABCpred server, 36, 37 which, as mentioned earlier, 21 have given good results. These tools indicate binding affinities of T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes (with 66% accuracy), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, and also of discontinuous epitopes through Ellipro."
