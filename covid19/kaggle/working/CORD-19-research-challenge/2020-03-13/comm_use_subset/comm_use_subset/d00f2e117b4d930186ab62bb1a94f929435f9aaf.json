    "Although in different groups, the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and NL63 use the same receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, for entry into the host cell. Despite this common receptor, the consequence of entry is very different; severe respiratory distress in the case of SARS-CoV but frequently only a mild respiratory infection for NL63. Using a wholly recombinant system, we have investigated the ability of each virus receptor-binding protein, spike or S protein, to bind to ACE-2 in solution and on the cell surface. In both assays, we find that the NL63 S protein has a weaker interaction with ACE-2 than the SARS-CoV S protein, particularly in solution binding, but the residues required for contact are similar. We also confirm that the ACE-2-binding site of NL63 S lies between residues 190 and 739. A lower-affinity interaction with ACE-2 might partly explain the different pathological consequences of infection by SARS-CoV and NL63.",
    "To investigate CoV S protein binding to ACE-2 in a unified format, we produced soluble and cell-bound versions of the two S proteins through the use of baculovirus expression vectors designed for secretion of proteins as Fc-tagged fusion proteins (Chen et al., 2007) or, separately, displayed on the insect cell surface following tagging with the VSV G protein transmembrane (TM) domain (Chapple & Jones, 2002 ) (see Supplementary Fig. S1 , available in JGV Online). The vectors are isogenic except for the tags employed and lead to the abundant expression of the target glycoproteins in the cells and supernatant for both the SARS-CoV and NL63 S proteins and subdomains thereof (Fig. 1 ). In addition, we produced a secreted form of ACE-2 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to provide a ligand with an alternate tag for the detection of ligand binding. In order to validate the interaction assays used, we produced two variants of the SARS-CoV S1 domain with alanine substitutions at arginine 426 (R426A) or asparagine 473 (N473A), known to reduce the affinity of SARS-CoV S1 interaction with ACE-2 (Chakraborti et al., 2005) . In addition, we introduced two alanine substitutions in the ACE-2 sequence at tyrosine 41 (Y41A) and lysine 353 (K353A), both of which have been mapped as important for the interaction of ACE-2 with SARS-CoV S (Li et al., 2005b) . With these differentially tagged and mutated potential ligands, we assessed the interaction of the CoV S proteins with ACE-2 by ELISA, pull-down and flow cytometry assays.",
    "Preliminary ELISAs capturing ACE-2-GFP to the plate, followed by incubation with the various Fc-tagged forms of S protein and detection with an anti-human Ig conjugate showed detectable interaction with SARS-CoV S and S1, but no interaction with either S1 R426A or N473A as expected (data not shown). Ligand binding was equally demonstrable in the alternate format of S capture followed by ACE-2-GFP and an anti-GFP probe. However, at equivalent concentrations of S protein, no interaction with NL63 S or any of its derivatives was detected in either assay format, suggesting an affinity of interaction for NL63 S with ACE-2 in solution that is substantially lower than that of SARS-CoV S. Supernatants containing Fc-tagged CoV S proteins were concentrated by spin dialysis, the levels of S protein present were normalized by quantitative Western blot and equivalent amounts of Fc-tagged S proteins were incubated with ACE-2-GFP in solution for 1 h at 21 u C. Following pull-down of the Fc components with protein A conjugated to Sepharose beads, the recovered contents were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the presence of CoV S proteins and GFP-tagged ACE-2 was detected by Western blot using anti-human Ig and anti-GFP antibodies, respectively. We observed that while SARS-CoV S and S1 pulled down ACE-2 effectively, NL63 S proteins pulled down between 10-and 100-fold less ACE-2 on a weightfor-weight basis (Fig. 2a) . ACE-2 interaction was apparent for NL63 S, NL63 S 15-739 and NL63 S 196-739 but not for NL63 S 15-195 (subscript numbers indicate the residues contained within each fragment) confirming that the unique 180 residue amino terminus of NL63 does not bind ACE-2 (Hofmann et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007) (Fig. 2) . Using SARS-CoV S1 and the minimum NL63 binding construct, NL63 S 196-739 , we tested the relative pull-down of ACE-2 with substitutions at residues 41 and 353. SARS-CoV S1 failed to interact significantly with ACE-2 Y41A (~2 %), it had reduced but demonstrable binding with K353A (~10 %) and did not pull down the double mutant (Fig. 2b) . NL63 S 196-739 also failed to effectively pull down ACE-2 Y41A and did not pull down either ACE-2 K353A or the double mutant (Y41A+K353A) (Fig. 2b ). Together these data show that NL63 S has a lower innate affinity for ACE-2 when compared with SARS-CoV S, and confirm the results of Li et al. (2007) which show that NL63 S and SARS-CoV S bind an overlapping ACE-2 sequence. However, this study demonstrated that the role of ACE-2 residue 353 was noticeably different. Substitution of the resident lysine for alanine reduced, but did not abolish, SARS-CoV S binding, while it effectively abolished binding by NL63 S. In addition, as the end points in our constructs differed somewhat from those published by Li et al. (2007) , our data reduced the carboxy-terminal boundary of the NL63 S RBD in an analogous Fc-fusion protein configuration from residue 749 to 739; however, this boundary is not reduced as far as residue 616 as recently described by Lin et al. (2008) . An affinity of interaction with ACE-2 by NL63 S of 10-100-fold less than that of SARS-CoV S would explain our inability to obtain a sound K d for the interaction by surface plasmon resonance. The SARS-CoV S1 affinity with ACE-2 was 8.71610 28 M ( Supplementary Fig. S2 , available in JGV Online), which is similar to published values (Li et al., 2005b) . However, the same assay format failed to record an accurate K d for the interaction of NL63 S with ACE-2."
