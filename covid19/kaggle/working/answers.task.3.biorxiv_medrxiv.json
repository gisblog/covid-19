    "Several studies predict a much larger number of infections than the actual number reported by the authorities, claiming that only between 10% and 20% of the cases have been detected and reported [6] [7] [8] [9] . The reasons for such deviations between models and actual count of cases are diverse, for instance, the fact that the symptoms could be mild and similar to other flue-like diseases for some people, may induce infected individuals not to seek medical care [10] . On the other hand, on Feb. 13th, 14,840 new cases were reported [11] , in contrast to 2,022 cases counted during the previous day [12] . The reason was that previously to that day, only those cases that had been laboratory-confirmed were being recognized as so, whereas from that date onwards, also the clinically diagnosed cases are accounted for. Therefore, the model-based prediction of the numbers of infected individuals can plausibly be larger than the official reports."

The fermented hemp seed protein extract caused inhibition of HCT116 cell proliferation that was statistically significant (p < 0.05). We attribute this effect to formation of bioactive peptides from edestin. Edestin is an hexameric globular protein that bears striking functional resemblance to DBP-MAF. We postulate that proteases secreted by the microbes of the probiotic formulation, together with the increase of acidity that is characteristic of fermentation, led to formation of peptides functionally very similar to DBP-MAF and, in",
    "Sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also denominated sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is an integral membrane protein with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The third extracellular domain of NTCP presents a stretch of nine aminoacids (KGIVISLVL) that is characterized by pronounced hydrophobicity and serves as receptor for a protein, preS1, showing the hydrophobic epta-peptide sequence NPLGFFP. Vitamin D-binding protein macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) is a multifunctional protein that is characterized by two hydrophobic regions able to bind fatty acids and vitamin D, respectively. Here we demonstrate that NTCP and DBP-MAF show significant sequence similarities as far as hydrophobic stretches of aminoacids are concerned. Alignment of the sequence of seven aminoacids preceding the 157-KGIVISLVL-165 stretch of NTCP shows four aminoacids that are identical to those of the corresponding sequence of DBP-MAF, and two that are conserved substitutions. In addition, in the sequence of DBP-MAF that is aligned with the sequence YKGIVISLVL of NTCP, there are two contiguous negatively charged aminoacids (ED) and, in the preceding epta-peptide sequence, there are three negatively charged aminoacids (D-ED), whereas in the corresponding sequence of NTCP there are only two (D--D) that are not contiguous. This concentration of negatively charged aminoacids may be involved in binding of protein inserts characterized by high density of positively charges residues. The alternating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions described in this paper may help elucidating the biological roles of these proteins as far as protein-protein interactions are concerned.",
    "The sodium-bile acid cotransporter, also defined the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) or also liver bile acid transporter, is an integral transmembrane protein that is encoded by the SLC10A1 (solute carrier family 10, member 1) human gene and shows multiple hydrophobic transmembrane domains (1) . This transporter plays a critical role in maintenance of the enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and hepatocyte function. The protein is constituted by 349 aminoacids with a resulting molecular mass of 56 kDa and works by binding two sodium ions and one (conjugated) bile salt molecule, in this manner determining hepatic influx of bile salts. Other molecules that may be transported by this protein comprise steroid and thyroid hormones, and xenobiotics of different origin (2) . NTCP also represents the receptor for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the interaction between the aminoacid sequences of NTCP and those of HBV surface proteins has been characterized in molecular details. The preS1 sequence of large envelope protein (L) is essential for interaction with a stretch of nine hydrophobic residues (157-KGIVISLVL-165) located in the third transmembrane domain of NTCP. The sequence of the preS1 L protein binding NTCP is constituted by a stretch of predominantly hydrophobic aminoacids (residues 2-48) and, within this stretch, there is a highly conserved motif (9-NPLGF(F/L)P-15) that is essential for binding (3) . It is apparent that knowledge of the mechanics of interaction at this level may be instrumental in developing strategies aimed at preventing preS1/NTCP interaction with consequent internalization. We therefore decided to use computational tools to investigate sequence similarities in other proteins that may interact with the preS1 sequence as well as with other surface proteins of viruses. To this end, we chose a well-characterized multifunctional serum protein that has the ability to work as a transporter, a hormone-and fatty acid binding protein, and an immune stimulating cytokine, the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) macrophage activating factor (MAF). This is a serum alpha-2 glycoprotein constituted by a single polypeptide chain showing a molecular mass of 51-58 kDa. From the structural point of view, it is related to serum albumin and it is also known as Gc (Group-component) globulin. DBP synthesis occurs in the liver and its level in human plasma is around 20-55 mg/100 ml. DBP is a multifunctional protein that, in addition to vitamin D, binds actin, acting as an actin scavenger, and also binds fatty acids. The protein is constituted by 458 aminoacids and shows three domains that share limited sequence similarity with each other as well as with similar sequences of human albumin. The first domain contains the vitamin D-binding site that is located in a shallow cleft that allows interaction with the plasma membrane. DBP is present on the surface of several cell types that comprise yolk sac endodermal cells and T lymphocytes. In B lymphocytes, DBP is responsible for the linkage of surface immunoglobulins, thus contributing to the balance of the immune response (4). The de-glycosylated form of DBP is a powerful macrophage activating factor -hence the designation DBP-MAF -and shows a number of biological effects (5) . We demonstrated that, in addition to its presence in human serum, DBP-MAF is formed during fermentation of milk and colostrum (6) as well as during fermentation of hemp seed proteins (7). Here, we demonstrate that DBP-MAF shares significant similarities with hydrophobic sequences of NTCP that interact with the preS1 sequence of L protein. We also show that DBP-MAF, but not NTCP, shares similarities between the hydrophobic sequence of the fatty acid binding site and the domain IV of the same L protein. Finally, we show the .

To better understand the potential infectivities of MERS-CoV in 51 bats, we developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris 52 pachypus and Rhinolophus sinicus (host of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4 and SARS-related-53",

The close phylogenetic relationship between bat and human DPP4 genes supported the 56 ability of MERS-CoV to infect bat cells, while DPP4 expression appeared critical for MERS-57"

    "As the predominant etiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is 19 the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed monovalent formalin-20 inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated 21 with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine 22 efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing 23 virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, 24 we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, 25 inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice 26 and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient 27 quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the 28 response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to 29 numerous and diverse HRV types.",

Three independent experiments using low input titers 306 showed similar results.

    "A novel coronavirus outbreak took place in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 31 2019 1 . This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in patients 2 and it has 32 rapidly spread to other provinces in China and other countries 3 . This novel coronavirus 33 outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission 34 route of the pathogen is still limited. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, 35 which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 36 Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine and hedgehog, can be 37 infected by different types of coronaviruses. Further sequence analyses of this novel and 38 other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the 39 evolution of SARS-CoV-2. 40 Preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms, and it has been evident 41 that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection 42 pressures 4-6 . There are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at amino acid level and the 43 other is at synonymous codon level. The amino acid composition of proteins can be an 44 important factor that explaining certain sequence traits. For example integral membrane 45 proteins that are enriched in hydrophobic amino acids can create significant codon usage 46 bias 7 . Amino acid composition sometime can also introduce confounding effects when one 47 only focuses on studying the variations of synonymous codon usage. The use of global 48 correspondence analysis (CA) and its derivatives within-group correspondence analysis 49 (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) to analyze codon usages can 50 overcome the above problem. In fact, WCA becomes \"model of choice\" for analyzing 51 synonymous codon usage in recent years, as it is more robust than other traditional methods 52 (e.g. CA with relative codon frequency or CA with RSCU values) 7,8 . This analytic approach, 53 however, has not been used in studying viral sequences. As the natural history of the SARS- 54 CoV-2 remains largely unknown, an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging 55 virus might provide some novel insights. 56 In this study, we used both CA and WCA to analyses codon usage patterns of a vast number 57 of betacoronavirus sequences. We found SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARSr-CoV have similar 58 amino acid usage. However, our analyses suggested that the spike and member genes of 59 SARS-CoV-2 have rather distinct synonymous codon usage patterns. Table S1 . 86 The codon count for every gene sequence input for the correspondence analysis was All the correspondence analyses in this study were performed individually for each gene, to 103 achieve better resolution on gene specific codon usage pattern. Gravy score provides an easy way to estimate the hydropathy character of a protein 15 . It was 117 used in this study as a proxy to identify proteins that are likely to be membrane-bound 118 proteins. The GRAVY score was calculated in a linear form on codon frequencies as: The overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order 140 ( Figure 1 ). We observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino 141 acids in the four studied genes, while tryptophan, histidine and methionine were the three 142 least used ones. We also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally 143 less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine. This pattern of uneven usage 144 in synonymous codons is in accordance with the G + C content distribution results (codons 145 ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observed). 146 We found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes, and this bias is well 147 explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins (results from global correspondence 148 analysis on all the four genes, collectively, data not shown). The GRAVY scores for every 149 sequence were calculated to represent the degree of hydropathy. We discovered that the 150 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

    "Correspondence analysis 154 We first conducted a multivariate analysis of codon usage on the dataset by using global 155 correspondence analysis. We also conducted WCA and BCA to study these sequences at 156 synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels, respectively. Given that there were 157 different amino acid usage biases among different genes (Supplementary Figure S3) , we 158 performed correspondence analyses of these genes separately. 159 Of all the four correspondence analyses for the four genes, the extracted first factors 160 explained more than 50% of the total variance (see Supplementary Figure S4 The global codon usages of bat RatG13 virus were found most similar to SARS-CoV-2 in 196 orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, but not in membrane gene ( Figure. 2). In the analysis 197 of membrane protein, pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 198 than all the other viruses. We found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin P1E and 199 SARS-CoV-2 were also high in orf1ab, where P1E was the second closest data point to 200 SARS-CoV-2. But this is not the case for spike and nucleocapsid genes. 201 We also observed that the codon usage pattern in spike gene was more complex than in other (Table   217 1). 218 Results from the BCA suggested that the amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related 219 to bat and human SARSr-CoVs in all four genes ( Figure 3B and Figure 4B ). Specifically, we 220 discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat RaTG13 Figure S8A ). It is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is 243 distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses. The difference in synonymous codon usage is 244 largely explained by the first factor (more than 50%), and our analysis on codon usages 245 suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending 246 .

We also had similar observation for the membrane 247 gene. Our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of SARS-248 CoV-2 in membrane was most similar to P1E and CoVZXC21 (Supplementary Figure S8B) . 249 It is worth noting that comparing to RaTG13, P1E and CoVZXC21 had lower synonymous 250 codon usage similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the other three genes. 251 Overall, our WCA results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on 252 spike and membrane genes, though we identified unique codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-253 2 on these two genes. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 In addition to global CA analysis, the application of WCA and BCA can eliminate the effects 279 caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage, respectively. These 280 alternative analytical tools were important to our study. It is because the amino acid 281 sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions 282 of the translated genes. By contrast, mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent, 283 as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a protein. The S protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry. The 302 genetic variability is extreme in spike gene 27 , and this highly mutable gene may possess 303 valuable information about recent evolution history. In our results, the synonymous codon 304 usage of SARS-CoV-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of RaTG13 and other 305 phylogenetic relatives ( Figure 3A) , which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene. 306 Although the codon usage in spike of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E were similar at amino 307 acid level, the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to 308 share a very recent common ancestor. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E 309 might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time. The amino 310 .

These findings suggest that there may be different selection 314 forces between genes. Our result supports different evolutionary background or currently 315 unknown host adaption history in SARS-CoV-2. The codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in 316 nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat SARSr-CoV both at amino acid level and synonymous 317 level, suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene. 318 Codon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces, including the influence from 319 host factors. Some researchers have hypothesised that the codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 320 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host 28 . However our recent study on 321 influenza A viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the 322 codon usage of a viral genome 19 . Our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of 323 Betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage, which warrants more 324 accurate but relatively conserved estimation. 325 "

We offer that these prior treatments are individual examples of a general phenomenon that would benefit from a mathematical treatment that is both more rigorous and more broadly applicable.

    "These methods have been successful in balancing simplicity with generality, and have spawned different classes of models, summarized both in terms of the particular mathematical instruments applied (e.g. discrete-time, continuous models, network models, etc) and the particular biologies of host-pathogen systems (e.g. sexually-transmitted, vectorborne disease, food-borne pathogen, etc) [5] , [6] . These methods have been effective in many cases, supported by dozens of examples where they have captured the essential character or dynamics of an epidemic [6] , [8] .

Effective interventions include limiting population mobility (e.g. cancellation of mass gathering, school closures and work-from-home arrangements) and public education (e.g. use of face masks and improved personal hygiene) (1)."

In the absence of an outside reference point, the reporting rate cannot be estimated from surveillance data only.

If further data, coming from a study in the general population, shows that this assumption is violated, this would lead to an overestimation of the CFR in our study."

Next, this virus infiltration 85 ranking is disentangled to contrast the poultry plus pig to the ruminant plus equine viruses, 86 as well as to separately consider the RNA, DNA and retroviruses in the study, also ranked in 87 an outer-to inner-body fashion. 94 As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 livestock viruses for the four 95 ecological variables were matched on the basis of Spearman correlation, see also S2 Fig reflects, respectively, acute, acute and persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the 589 score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and 590 above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number 591 of days that the virus remains infective outside the host body, ranging from up to three, 592 three to ten, to over ten days.

    "In conclusion, the results presented in this study show that many protein regions rely on metal binding disulfide bonds for stability, which are potentially redox-regulated, and involve structural transitions from an ordered state to a disordered state, or vice versa. The abundance of these types of regions dramatically increases from yeast to human, and involves a wide range of processes related to multicellularity, signaling and regulation of transcription and translation.",
    "The set of human proteins containing predicted redox-sensitive conditionally disordered protein regions (RSCDP) was determined as described for all proteomes. The list of 5,644 proteins together with the 10,109 identified regions is listed in the Supplementary material.",
    "At the organism level, the cellular functions involving redox-regulated conditionally disordered protein regions are typically embedded in a wide variety of developmental processes. Several of these processes are focused on either reproduction, such as the formation of a labyrinthine layer, or the very early developmental stages of life, such as somitogenesis, gastrulation, or endoderm formation. As these high level organismal processes typically rely on a large number of proteins, they do not show exclusivity towards either structural element. ",
    "Judging by sheer numbers of occurrence, the most abundant domain of interest in humans is the C2H2 zinc finger. This structural unit is present in all three studied proteomes in high numbers. Furthermore, the ratio of conditionally disordered C2H2 domains compared to the total number of such domains is surprisingly stable across the three organisms, with values of 59.5%, 66.6%, and 53.9%, for yeast, drosophila and human. This indicates that the study of the redox-sensitivity of simple model organisms, such as yeast can have implications in human physiology as well. The identification and functional characterization of redox-sensing structural switches can therefore serve as a guide to the understanding of the more complex roles these protein regions play in human regulation."

In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an 22 assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of 23 nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds).

These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, 28 indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two 29 well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel 30 Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was 31 reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably, 32 within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or 33 foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A 34 virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus. Overall, we 35 demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species 36 aggregations.",
    "Many hosts are members of multi-species aggregations and may be infected by an assemblage of 43 specialist and/or multi-host generalist infectious agents. Host community diversity is central to 44 pathogen dynamics (1, 2), and pathogen species richness, relative abundance, specificity and intra- 45 and inter-species interactions within assemblages likely have complex roles in modulating pathogen 46 levels within populations (1, (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . A significant limitation in studying viral communities in hosts is 47 that most viral species remained undescribed (9), such that viral ecology across multi-host systems 48 has been limited to \"single-virus\" dynamics, particularly in vertebrate systems (for example, 49 Influenza A virus [IAV] in avian populations). With the advent of unbiased, bulk 'meta-50 transcriptomic' RNA sequencing we can now explore, in more detail, how viral community structure 51 may be shaped by host-species interactions. 52 Birds of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, the central reservoirs for avian viruses such 53 as IAV, avian avulavirus and avian coronavirus (10, 11), form multi-host flocks, in which many 54 species may migrate, forage, or roost together (e.g. (12) . These flocks may comprise species along a 55 taxonomically related gradient and may utilize similar or different ecological niches in the same 56 environment. For example, in Australia, taxonomically related dabbling Grey Teals (Anas gracilis) 57 and Pacific Black Ducks (Anas superciliosa) may share the environment with the distantly related 58 filter feeding Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceus). These multi-host flocks form 59 multi-host maintenance communities (6), with consequences for virus ecology, transmission, and 60 virulence (1, 13, 14) . 61 Studies of the ecology of IAV, the best studied multi-host virus in wild birds, have shown that not all 62 hosts are equal (15, 16 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

    "Is the outbreak of an infectious disease caused by a new or a previously known virus (Box 1)? This is among the first and principal questions because the answer informs measures to detect the causative agent, control its transmission and limit potential consequences of the epidemic. It also has implications for the virus name. On a different time scale, the answer also helps to define research priorities in virology and public health.",
    "To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the CSG recommends that researchers describing new isolates of this virus and other viruses in this species adopt a standardized format for public databases and publications. The proposed naming convention includes a reference to the host organism that the virus was isolated from, the time of isolation, and the place of isolation (geographic location): Virus/Isolate/Host/Date/Location, e.g. SARS-CoV-2/X1/Human/2019/Wuhan. This complete designation along with additional and important characteristics, such as association with pathogenicity in humans or other hosts, should be included in the submission of each isolate genome sequence to public databases, e.g. GenBank.",
    "Even without knowing anything on the species concept of classifying different forms of life, every human recognizes another human as being a member of the (same) species Homo sapiens. However, for assigning individual living organisms to most other species, specialized knowledge and tools for assessing inter-individual differences are required. The CSG uses a computational framework of comparative genomics 22 that is shared by several Study Groups concerned with the classification and nomenclature of the order Nidovirales and coordinated by the Nidovirales Study Group 23 (Box 3). The Study Groups quantify and partition the variation in the most conserved replicative proteins encoded in open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a/1b) of the coronavirus genome ( Fig. 2A) to identify thresholds on pair-wise patristic distances (PPD) that demarcate virus clusters at different ranks."

    "Previous investigations into pairwise determinants of viral sharing have been limited to one 47 or two host orders (e.g., bats 17,18 , primates 19 , ungulates 16 , and carnivores 14,16 ), while 48 sometimes lumping together different types of pathogen (e.g., helminths, viruses, and 49 bacteria). Viruses are sometimes shared across large host phylogenetic distances (e.g., Nipah 50 virus in bats and pigs, among many others 20,21 ), requiring a broader understanding of viral 51 sharing across mammals to predict patterns at different taxonomic and geographic scales. In 52 addition, many mammalian orders have yet to be investigated in these analysesmost 53 notably rodents, which are highly diverse and host important zoonotic viruses 5, 8 . In addition, 54 although phylogenetic and geographic viral sharing effects have been empirically 55 demonstrated, the models have not yet been applied to validate viral sharing predictions using 56 external datasets or make inferences about mammals with no known viral associations. If 57 geographic and phylogenetic effects on viral sharing are as ubiquitous as they seem, these 58 variables alone could provide a useful baseline model of viral sharing applicable across the 59 mammal class."

In addition, primer Tm and length can also be fine-tuned to harmonize the amplification reaction conditions [16, 17] . The tailed primers have been reported to provide higher PCR yields and sensitivity [16, 17, 18] . Unfortunately, the underlying mechanism behind the action of flap primers is still unknown."

Evaluation of children and adolescents' transmission risks is of particular interest in determining school closure duration and children's wellbeing and education [2] . Public disclosure information indicates that children with 10 years of age or younger have higher risks of infection than slightly older adolescents. Therefore, local kindergarten and primary schools should postpone their admission and regular operation, to at least not earlier than local secondary schools.",
    "+ These first authors contributed equally to this article BACKGROUND As of February 29, 2020, nearly 80 thousand confirmed novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection cases had been reported in China. Risk factors for transmission remain largely uncharacterized. The reproduction of infection can be characterized in two major scenarios, i.e., within-households and between-households [1]. Within-household transmission provides important information of infections cross age groups and genders. Estimation of the within-household transmission for SARS-CoV-2 is particularly important for disease control to characterize whether household contact might be driving the outbreak. If it transpires that virus is prone to transmit to a particular age group or gender, then special measures can be taken to control the transmission [2]. This study describes the transmission of the virus within households and close contacts.",
    "Our results suggest that male family members are the primary sources of infections in the family. As shown in Table 2 , the proportion of male to female transmission in household is 44.0% (253 in 574 cases with disclosed information, with 98 husband-to-wife cases, 89 son to parents cases, 61 father to children cases and 24 brother to brother/sister cases), higher than cases of transmission from female to male cases (19.0%, with only 28 wife-to-husband cases) and between the same genders (36.9%).

    "Importantly, this approach assumes that none of the observed cases remains infectious and that there are no patients who are already infected but are pre-symptomatic. This may be a reasonable assumption if transmission primarily occurs when patients are symptomatic and if symptomatic patients are quickly quarantined. However, until there has been a substantial gap in time (at least one serial interval) since a patient is quarantined this assumption cannot be validated. This approach also does not account for the possibility of symptomatic cases that remain unobserved. Further, subcriticality in one subpopulation does not imply subcriticality in other populations. In addition, if the capacity for isolation is exceeded due to an excess of imported cases, subcriticality now does not imply subcriticality in the future.",

    "Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten wildlife populations. Most studies focus 27 on managing short-term epidemic properties, such as controlling early outbreaks. Predicting 28 long-term endemic characteristics with limited retrospective data is more challenging. We 29 used individual-based modelling informed by individual variation in pathogen load and 30 transmissibility to predict long-term impacts of a lethal, transmissible cancer on Tasmanian 31 devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations. For this, we employed Approximate Bayesian 32 Computation to identify model scenarios that best matched known epidemiological and 33 demographic system properties derived from ten years of data after disease emergence, 34 enabling us to forecast future system dynamics. We show that the dramatic devil population 35 declines observed thus far are likely attributable to transient dynamics. Only 21% of 36 matching scenarios led to devil extinction within 100 years following devil facial tumour 37 disease (DFTD) introduction, whereas DFTD faded out in 57% of simulations. In the 38 remaining 22% of simulations, disease and host coexisted for at least 100 years, usually with 39 long-period oscillations. Our findings show that pathogen extirpation or host-pathogen 40 coexistence are much more likely than the DFTD-induced devil extinction, with crucial 41 management ramifications. Accounting for individual-level disease progression and the long-42 term outcome of devil-DFTD interactions at the population-level, our findings suggest that 43 immediate management interventions are unlikely to be necessary to ensure the persistence of 44",

    "One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how codon choice influences 27 population diversity and evolvability. Here we compared the development of HIV-1 28 resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) between wild-type (WT) virus and a synthetic 29 virus (MAX) carrying a codon-pair re-engineered protease sequence including 38 (13%) 30 synonymous mutations. WT and MAX viruses showed indistinguishable replication in 31 MT-4 cells or PBMCs. Both viruses were subjected to serial passages in MT-4 cells 32 with selective pressure from the PIs atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV). After 32 33 successive passages, both the WT and MAX viruses developed phenotypic resistance to 34",
    "PIs (IC 50 14.6 \u00b1 5.3 and 21.2 \u00b1 9 nM for ATV, and 5. 9 \u00b1 1.0 and 9.3 \u00b1 1.9 for DRV, 35 respectively). Ultra-deep sequence clonal analysis revealed that both viruses harbored 36 previously described resistance mutations to ATV and DRV. However, the WT and 37 MAX virus proteases showed different resistance variant repertoires, with the G16E and 38 V77I substitutions observed only in WT, and the L33F, S37P, G48L, Q58E/K, and L89I 39 substitutions detected only in MAX. Remarkably, G48L and L89I are rarely found in 40 vivo in PI-treated patients. The MAX virus showed significantly higher nucleotide and 41 amino acid diversity of the propagated viruses with and without PIs (P < 0.0001), 42 suggesting higher selective pressure for change in this recoded virus. Our results 43 indicate that HIV-1 protease position in sequence space delineates the evolution of its 44 mutant spectra. Nevertheless, the investigated synonymously recoded variant showed 45 mutational robustness and evolvability similar to the WT virus.",

In this study, we evaluated how synonymous recoding of 52 the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease impacts the development of 53 protease inhibitor (PI) resistance. HIV-1 protease is a main target of current 54 antiretroviral therapies. Our present results demonstrate that the wild-type (WT) virus 55 and the virus with the recoded protease exhibited different patterns of resistance 56 mutations after PI treatment. Nevertheless, the developed PI resistance phenotype was 57 indistinguishable between the recoded virus and the WT virus, suggesting that the 58 synonymously recoded protease HIV-1 and the WT protease virus were equally robust 59 and evolvable."

    "The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a novel 28 betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-29 CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. Coronavirus has a history of 30 causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a 31 novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea 32 syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus 33 of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 34 (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it 35 can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is 36 determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in 37 viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM 38 structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 39 3.55 \u00c5. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit 40 quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit 41 pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with 42 that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-43 CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, 44 such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by 45 glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data 46 provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and 47 would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which 48 ."

    "20 BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has 21 spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly 22 influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its 23 control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in 24 China. fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of 29 population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; 30 City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). 31 The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with 32 reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was 33 inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p <0.001) and infection rates (r =-0.4912, p <0.01). 34 Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r =-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure 35 rates (r = 0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. 36 CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily 37 to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and 38 adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved 39 prognosis of affected individuals."

    "Background. T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is a phosphatidylserine (PS) 28 receptor, mediating filovirus entry into cells through interactions with PS on virions. TIM-1 29 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains 30 unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have 31 suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a 32 BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein and demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 33 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. 34",
    "suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher 43 virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-44 sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more 45 modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were 46 depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. 47",
    "53 Author summary 54 T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) is one of a number of phosphatidylserine (PS) 55 receptors that mediate clearance of apoptotic bodies by binding PS on the surface of dead or 56 dying cells. Enveloped viruses mimic apoptotic bodies by exposing PS on the outer leaflet of the 57 viral membrane. While TIM-1 has been shown to serve as an adherence factor/receptor for 58 filoviruses in tissue culture, limited studies have investigated the role of TIM-1 as a receptor in 59 vivo. Here, we sought to determine if TIM-1 was critical for Ebola virus glycoprotein-mediated 60 infection using a BSL2 model virus. We demonstrate that loss of TIM-1 expression results in 61 decreased virus load late during infection and significantly reduced virus-elicited mortality. 62 These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 serves as an important receptor for Ebola virus in 63 vivo. Blocking TIM-1/EBOV interactions may be effective antiviral strategy to reduce viral load 64 and pathogenicity at late times of EBOV infection. 65 66 .

They 2 are also asymptomatic hosts for numerous viruses, including recently emerged zoonotic 3 Henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, which are highly pathogenic for humans and other mammals. 4 Better understanding of how bats control viral infection requires development of relevant permissive 5 cellular experimental models. By applying a somatic reprogramming protocol to Pteropus bat primary 6 cells, using a novel combination of ESRRB, CDX2, and c-MYC transcription factors, we generated 7 bat reprogrammed cells exhibiting stem cell-like characteristics and a neural stem cell-like molecular 8 signature. These cells present a unique interferon-stimulated transcriptomic signature and both 9 produce and respond to interferon type-I, highlighting differences between stem cells from bats and 10 other mammals. In contrast to primary bat cells, these reprogrammed cells are highly susceptible to 11 infection by Henipavirus, thereby enabling isolation of new bat viruses, study of virus-bat 12 interactions, and better understanding of bat biology.",

    "Y4F is restored following vaccination with a proline-altered peptide ligand (APL). The APL 9 increases MHC/peptide (pMHC) complex stability, rigidifies the peptide and facilitates T cell 10 receptor (TCR) recognition through reduced entropy costs. Structural analyses of pMHC 11 complexes before and after TCR binding, combined with biophysical analyses, revealed that 12 although the TCR binds similarly to all complexes, the p3P modification alters the conformations 13 of a very limited amount of specific MHC and peptide residues, facilitating efficient TCR 14 recognition. This approach can be easily introduced in peptides restricted to other MHC alleles, 15 and can be combined with currently available and future vaccination protocols in order to prevent 16 viral immune escape.

We 24 believe that this approach can be implemented to currently available or novel vaccination 25 approaches to efficiently restore T cell recognition of virus escape variants to control disease 26 progression. pMHC stability and immunogenicity has been to optimize interactions between peptide anchor 62 residues and MHC binding pockets [17] [18] [19] . However, escape variants that target TCR recognition 63 often exhibit optimal MHC anchor residues, reducing possibilities for such modifications. 64 .

Next, P14 TCR down-regulation was assessed upon exposure to gp33, V3P, Y4F or PF-loaded H-120 2D b+ RMA cells (Fig. 1C) . While H-2D b /gp33 induced significant TCR down-regulation, none 121 was detected with Y4F, even at high peptide concentrations. Exposure of P14 T cells to V3P 122 equaled or increased TCR internalization compared to gp33. Importantly, exposure to PF 123 significantly increased P14 TCR down-regulation compared to Y4F (Fig. 1C) . The crystal 124 structures of H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF were determined to 2.5 and 2.6 \u00c5 resolution, respectively 125 .

The backbone of the p3P-APL corresponds exactly to the wild-type 129 peptides, indicating strict molecular mimicry (Fig. 1D) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

This is well in line with previous studies in which the Y4F-specific T cell 174 clone YF.F3 killed efficiently targets presenting gp33 but did not produce IFNg [32] . Similar 175 results were obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)-derived T cells (Fig. S4 ). In conclusion, The p3P modification facilitates TCR recognition 209 The three ternary TCR/MHC/peptide structures were compared with each corresponding TCR-210 unbound pMHC (Fig. 4, Fig. S8 ). The side chain of p4Y, essential for recognition by P14 [4, 33, 211 34], rotates down following P14 binding to both H-2D b /gp33 and H-2D b /V3P (Fig. 4A-B) . A 212 similar rotation was also observed for residue p4F in H-2D b /PF upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4C) . 213 The side chain of p6F in gp33 is also affected upon binding to P14 (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the 214 p3P modification resulted in a similar conformation for p6F in both H-2D b /V3P and H-2D b /PF 215 prior to binding to P14 ( Fig. 1D and Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the side chain of residue p1K in H-216 2D b /gp33 also moves towards the N-terminal of the peptide binding cleft following P14 binding 217 (Fig. 4A) , taking an identical conformation as in both p3P-substituted peptides (Fig. 4D) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862144 doi: bioRxiv preprint 12 P14 docking, p3V in gp33 extends 1.2 \u00c5 deeper into the D-pocket of H-2D b , combined with a 180\u00b0 222 rotation (Fig. 4A) . In contrast to gp33, the p2-p4 section is more constrained in both V3P and PF, 223 following TCR binding (Fig. 4B, 4C ). However, it should be noted that the final conformations of 224 all three peptides in the ternary complexes is nearly identical (Fig. 4D ). In conclusion, residues 1 225 and 6 in p3P-APLs take the same conformations prior to TCR binding as found in the ternary 226 complexes, potentially enabling a more favorable surface for P14 TCR binding. Furthermore, p1K in gp33 also takes a different conformation upon binding to P14, bending 239 backwards towards the H-2D b residues R62 and E163, which conformations are affected (Fig. 4A , 240 5A). Here again, the side chain of p1K takes exactly this conformation in both V3P and PF already 241 before TCR binding (Fig. 4, 5) . Altogether, p1K, P6F and heavy chain residues R62, H155 and 242 E163 have already adopted in the unbound V3P and PF complexes similar conformations to those 243 observed in all three ternary structures (Fig. 4, 5) . Thus, the p3P substitution potentially facilitates 244 TCR recognition by positioning specific key peptide and MHC residues prior to the formation of 245 .

This is well in line with our SPR and ITC results, which indicate that the 246 energy required for P14 recognition of V3P is reduced compared to gp33 (Table 1, Fig. S1 ). The results presented within this study indicate in our opinion that i) docking of P14 to p3P-331 modified peptides is facilitated since the conformations of key residues in both peptide and heavy 332 chain are already optimal prior to TCR binding (ready-to-go conformation); ii) consequently, the 333 energetic costs for TCR recognition should be reduced since there is no need for any major 334 movement in the rigidified epitope besides the conformational change for residue p4Y.

As a consequence, here, the purification of porcine gastric MUC5AC is performed manually from fresh pig stomachs. An optimization of the original purification protocol from Celli et.al 6 was described in detail previously 3 . In brief, crude mucus was obtained by gently scraping pig stomachs after rinsing them with tap water. The mucus was diluted 5-fold in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, supplemented with 170 mM NaCl) and homogenized by stirring at 4 \u00b0C overnight.

Afterwards, the supernatant was separated chromatographically by size-exclusion chromatography (\u00c4KTA purifier system, GE Healthcare, equipped with a XK50/100 column packed with Sepharose 6FF), and the fractions containing the mucin glycoproteins were identified via PAS (periodic acid/Schiff's base) staining and pooled.

Further purification of salivary mucin MUC5B was conducted according to the protocol used for purifying gastric mucin MUC5AC as described above."

There were cases in at least 15 other countries, identified due to symptoms plus recent travel history to Hubei province, China, which strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in China 2 . While the most affected region, Hubei province, has now ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes 3 it is unlikely that these measures will fully contain the outbreak.",

    "It is important to note that our estimates are based on a number of key assumptions that cannot yet be informed directly by evidence from the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. The current outbreak has spread rapidly and early evidence suggests that the average severity is lower than SARS. This may also suggest a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases. A recent analysis of a family transmission cluster is based on a small sample size but 1 in 6 infections was asymptomatic 9 ; a major impediment for the effectiveness of syndromic screening. However, if asymptomatic cases were not infectious they would not pose a risk for seeding infection chains on arrival. To allow easy adaptation of our results as new insight becomes available in the coming weeks we developed an online app."

    "Coronaviruses are single positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to Coronaviridae family 1 , which are divided into four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Delta-and Gammacoronavirus. CoVs are commonly found in many species of animals, including bats, camels and humans. Occasionally, the animal CoVs can acquire genetic mutations by errors during genome replication or recombination mechanism, which can further expand their tropism to humans. The first human CoVs were discovered in the mid-1960s. A total of six human CoV types were identified to be responsible for causing human respiratory ailments, which include two alpha CoVs (229E; NL63), and four beta CoVs (OC43; HKU1; SARS-CoV; MERS-CoV) 2 .

Our prediction for 93 novel HIV variants showed good correlation with the experimentally measured values (r=0.32, Fig 4E) , which could be further improved by applying more restrictive filtering (r=0.44, Fig 4F; see Methods). This shows that a model based on data from our assay is sensitive enough to detect even subtle differences between HIV variants and allows prediction of frameshifting rates with an accuracy of clinical relevance.",

Accordingly, we assigned a percentage to every variant that passed filtering for read number, bin profile and expression levels (by gating for a narrow range of mCherry fluorescence to minimize effects coming from the influence of the variable region on overall expression levels, Methods). This percentage value does not necessarily denote the precise rate of frameshifting events, but gives us a meaningful measure of frameshifting efficiencies across PRF events. Based on the peak of negative, non-frameshifting variants we assigned a noise threshold (corresponding to 1.7% Figure 1 .

Fortunately, the development of milder detergents and detergent stabilized bilayer systems (bicelles) has helped to overcome this problem (7, 8, 13, 14) . Importantly, the solution behaviour of many commercially available detergents has been well characterised using a range of techniques, including small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (15) .

Similar survival kinetics were 378 previously reported in IFNAR KO mice infected with other SFTSV strains [11, 14] , 379 indicating that our Korean SFTSV isolate possesses an equivalent degree of virulence to prior 380 Chinese isolates. The platelet counts in mice infected with 1 x 10 5 FFU of SFTSV 381 significantly declined up to 4 d after infection, and the mean platelet volumes of the infected 382 mice were significantly higher than those of control animals (S3 Fig B) , suggesting that 383 platelet destruction and the activation of platelet production simultaneously occur during 384 lethal infection [14] .",

Gradual rise of disease incidence 59 and relatively high mortality have become a serious public health problem in the endemic 60 countries. In this study, we developed a recombinant plasmid DNA encoding four antigens, 61 Gn, Gc, NP, and NS, of SFTS virus (SFTSV) as a vaccine candidate. In order to enhance cell-62 mediated immunity, the viral antigens were fused with Flt3L and IL-2 gene was incorporated 63 into the plasmid. Immunization with the DNA vaccine provides complete protection against 64 lethal SFTSV infection in IFNAR KO mice. Antigen-specific T cell responses might play a 65 major role in the protection since we observed enhanced T cell responses specific to the viral 66 antigens but failed to detect neutralizing antibody in the immunized mice. When we 67 immunized with either viral glycoprotein, Gn protein induced relatively higher neutralizing 68 activity and better protection against SFTSV infection than Gc antigen, but neither generated 69 complete protection. Therefore, an optimal combination of DNA and protein elements, as 70 well as proper selection of target antigens, might be required to produce an effective SFTSV 71 vaccine. 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 .

    "For each candidate taxon (i.e. species in primary and strains in secondary iteration, respectively), raw counts are calculated by summing over all assigned PSMs including non-unique matches. To account for taxonomic biases caused by shared matches, we integrate a weighting scheme based on the level of uniqueness using the global frequency of a PSM. Here, a PSM count per taxon is adjusted by the number of occurrences in all candidate taxa. Thereby, unique PSMs gain in value for the final taxa selection without fully neglecting the importance of high numbers of non-unique matches that are often highly present within closely related taxa such as strains.",
    "The TaxIt workflow for strain identification consists of several recurring modules interconnected, controlled (in terms of input and output) and automatically executed by the Snakemake computational workflow management system 46 . The designed workflow executes up to three stages including (i) an optional host filter, (ii) species identification (primary iteration) and (iii) strain identification (secondary iteration). A concise overview of the workflow is illustrated in Figure 1 . The main steps of each iteration are the execution of a peptide search engine, false discovery rate (FDR) control, taxonomic classification, taxa counting and adjustment as well as candidate selection and visualization. The automated download of strain proteomes bridges the primary and secondary iteration. The procedures of the main modules are described in detail below.",
    "The central step in the analysis of MS/MS spectra is an efficient peptide search for comprehensive protein identification. Therefore, we rely on established and reliable open-source database search engines such as X!Tandem 47 in combination with the XTandem Parser 48 and MS-GF+ 49 . However, any command-line search engine including proprietary ones could be implemented via additional Snakemake rules. We apply a classic target-decoy approach for false discovery rate (FDR) control 50 . Decoy sequences are created upfront and independently of the search engine with fasta-decoy.pl 51 by reversing the target sequences (including contaminant proteins, for instance cRAP 52 ) and both target and decoy databases are concatenated as suggested by Jeong et al. 20 . PSMs are subjected to an FDR cutoff based on a per-match FDR calculated as Ndecoy/Ntarget, with Ndecoy being the number of decoys in between targets (Ntarget) in a list of matches sorted by e-value 20, 53 . To acknowledge established false positive hits of previous iterations, decoy sequences with an e-value above the FDR-cutoff are passed on and concatenated to the database of the next iteration."

In some situations, empiric regimens may lack activity against an underlying microbe, leading to treatment failure, disease progression, and consequent adverse outcomes (5, 9) . Furthermore, in transplant patients, concern for GVHD may compel clinicians to initiate empiric immunosuppressive agents that could inadvertently exacerbate disease in the presence of an unrecognized infection (10) .",

This variation fuels adaptation, and selective sweeps leave genetic marks of past ecological history in viral genomes. These fixed mutations can alter the fitness landscape and constrain evolutionary trajectories of viruses due to epistatic interactions between mutations (13) . Virus evolution is known to be shaped by epistasis, detected by both laboratory experimentation and phylogenetic analysis (14) (15) (16) , and increased understanding of epistasis promises to improve our predictions of why some viral emergence events are more successful than others (17) .",

    "For well-annotated genomes, we compile a ranking of genes (or other genomic features) sorted by the average infectious potential within a given region. In addition to that, we scan the genome with the learned filters of the first convolutional layer to find genes enriched in subsequences yielding nonzero filter activations. We use Gene Ontology to connect the identified genes of interest with their molecular functions and biological processes they are engaged in.",
    "We use an all-zero reference. As reads from real sequencing runs are usually not equally long, shorter reads must be padded with N s; the \"unknown\" nucleotide is also called whenever there is not enough evidence to assign any other to the raw sequencing signal. Therefore, N s are \"null\" nucleotides and are a natural candidate for the reference input. We do not consider alternative solutions based on GC content or dinucleotide shuffling, as the input reads originate from multiple different species, and the sequence composition may itself be a strong marker of both virus and host taxonomy.",
    "Using the formalism of DeepLIFT's multipliers (Shrikumar et al., 2019a) and their reinterpretation in SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) , we backpropagate the activation differences only along the paths \"passing through\" y j . In Eq. 1, we define partial multipliers \u00b5 (yj ) xiz and express them in terms of Shapley values \u03c6 and activation differences w.r.t. the expected activation values (reference activation). Calculating partial multipliers is equivalent to zeroing out the multipliers m y k z for all k = j before backpropagating m yj z further.",
    "In each of the evaluated settings, we used a total of 20 million (80%) reads for training, 2.5 million (10%) reads for validation and 2.5 million (10%) paired reads as the heldout test set. Read number per genome was proportional to genome length, keeping the coverage uniform on average. While the original datasets are heavily imbalanced, we generated the same number of negative and positive data points (reads) regardless of the negative class definition used.",
    "We wanted the networks to yield accurate predictions for both 250bp (our data, modelling a sequencing run of an Illumina MiSeq device) and 150bp long reads (as in the Human Blood Virome dataset). As shorter reads are padded with zeroes, we expected the CNNs trained using average pooling to misclassify many of them. Therefore, we prepared a modified version of the \"Stratified\" dataset, in which the last 100bp of each read were turned to zeros, mocking a shorter sequencing run while preserving the error model. Then, we retrained the CNN which had performed best on the original dataset. Since in principle, the Human Blood Virome dataset should not contain viruses infecting non-human Chordata, a \"Chordata\"-trained classifier was not used in this setting."

    "For continue variables description, mean with standard deviation was used for normal distribution data and median with interquartile range (IQR) was used for non-normal distribution data. Cumulative seroconversion rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. The association between antibody level and severity of illness were estimated by generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with logit link function. All statistical analysis was conducted by SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).",

    "Coronaviruses (CoVs), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, are positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses and cause infections in birds, mammals, and humans (1) (2) (3) . The family includes four genera, such as Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (4) . Two infamous infectious coronaviruses in the genus Betacoronavirus are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (5) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (6) , which have infected more than 10,000 people around the world in the past two decades. Unfortunately, the incidence was accompanied by high mortality rates (9.6% for SARS-CoV and 34.4% for MERS-CoV), indicating that there is an urgent need for effective treatment at the beginning of the outbreak to prevent the spread (7, 8) . However, this cannot be achieved with current drug development or an application system, taking several years for newly developed drugs to come to the market.",
    "To train the model, the Drug Target Common (DTC) database (11) and BindingDB (12) database were manually curated and combined. Three types of efficacy value, Ki, Kd, and IC50 were integrated by a consistence-score-based averaging algorithm (13) to make the Pearson correlation score over 0.9 in terms of Ki, Kd, and IC50. Since the BindingDB database includes a wide variety of species and target proteins, the MT-DTI model has the potential power to predict interactions between antiviral drugs and 2019-nCoV proteins."
