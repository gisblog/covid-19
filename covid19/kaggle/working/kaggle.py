# problem statement - find closest answers to key questions from a corpus of scientific papers
###

goal:
given the urgency of helping find a cure within the many scientific papers released, the goal here is to extract relevant answers to the questions posed so that the scientific community can pinpoint its research.

steps:
#. collect tasks' QUESTIONS.
#. walk given path for papers.
#. if conditions are met, then write paper paths to a main papers file.
#. given a list of papers in the main file, write the top unique answers to a task's QUESTIONS by evaluating the papers:
    #. for each paper, do -
    #. collect each QUESTION and relevant elements from the paper.
    #. convert the collection of words to vectors.
    #. calculate euclidean distances from the QUESTIONS to the paper elements, and sort by similarity/distance.
    #. from the sorting, remove the original QUESTIONS and write the top unique answers to an answer file.
#. walk given path for answer files.
#. if conditions are met, then merge all answers on a given path by task # into a main answer file.

# NLP: pros and cons of using CountVectorizer over HashingVectorizer (or TfidfVectorizer) -
# CountVectorizer uses in-memory vocabulary.
# HashingVectorizer doesn't have a way to compute the inverse transform (from feature indices to string feature names).
# This can be a problem when trying to introspect which features are most important to a model.
# Also, no idf (inverse document frequency) weighting -
# idf measures how important a word is to a doc in a collection of docs.
# tfâ€“idf increases with the # of times a word appears in a doc.
# tf-idf decreases with the # of docs in the collection that contain the word.

    word2vec is a group of models that represents each word in a large text as a vector in a space of n-dimensions (or features) making similar words closer to each other. on the other hand, 1-hot encoding doesn't have similarity using distance.
    
    the euclidean distance (or cosine similarity) between 2 word vectors provided an effective method for measuring the linguistic/semantic similarity of the 2 words. nearest neighbor reveals relevant similarities outside an average vocabulary. similarity metrics used in nearest neighbor evaluations produce 1 scalar that quantifies the relatedness of its 2 words. this simplicity can be an issue since 2 words may exhibit other relationships. in order to capture that in a quantitative way, it is necessary to associate more than 1 number to a word pair.
    
    populating glove required 1 pass through the entire covid19 dataset. for the large covid19 dataset, this pass was computationally expensive. subsequent training iterations would have been faster. also, pre-trained word vector datasets downloaded (eg wikipedia 2014 + gigaword 5) didn't match the semantics for covid19. # todo: train word vectors on covid19 corpus.

    # - ignore terms that have a min_df/max_df lower/higher than given:
    # - max_df = 0.50 means "ignore terms that appear in more than 50% of the docs"
    # - max_df = 25 means "ignore terms that appear in more than 25 docs"
    # - min_df = 0.01 means "ignore terms that appear in less than 1% of the docs"
    # - min_df = 5 means "ignore terms that appear in less than 5 docs"
    # - if float, represents a proportion of docs. if integer, represent absolute counts.
    # analyzer: word or char/char_wb n-grams.
    # - n-gram = contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text.
    # - eg for sample "to be or not to be", 1-gram: [to, be, or, not, to, be], 2-gram: [to be, be or, or not, not to, to be].
    # ngram_range: unigrams (n=1, bag of words) can't capture phrases/multi-word expressions, and disregards word order dependence.
    # - bag of words (bow) model doesnâ€™t account for misspellings/word derivations/stemmings either.
    # - so instead of unigrams, use bigrams (n=2) where occurrences of pairs of consecutive words are counted.
    # - if analyzer isn't callable.
    # stop_words: if 'None', max_df used. if 'english', built-in stop word list used. if analyzer='word', [list] used.
